This document provides a guide in setting up R/RStudio to work on *The Primer*.

1) Install the latest released versions of R and RStudio. 

https://happygitwithr.com/install-r-rstudio.html

2) Make sure that your Git/Github connections are good. If you have gone through https://happygitwithr.com/ --- as you should have --- then these may already be OK. If not (or, even if you have), then you need to run `git_sitrep().` 

> install.packages("usethis")
> library(usethis)
> git_sitrep()
Git config (global)* 
Name: 'David Kane'* 
Email: 'dave.kane@gmail.com'* 
Vaccinated: FALSE
...
GitHub* 
Personal access token: '<found in env var>'* 
User: 'davidkane9'* 
Name: 'David Kane'* 
Email(s): '<unknown>'
...

I left out some of the output.

If the first part --- Git config --- seems messed up, execute:

> use_git_config(user.name = "David Kane", user.email = "dave.kane@gmail.com")

If the second part seems messed up, try:

> usethis::browse_github_pat()

and follow the instructions. You must put the PAT you generate into your .Renviron file. Restart R and then run git_sitrep() again to make sure that things look like mine, more or less.

3) Installs these packages:

remotes::install_github("grimbough/msmbstyle")
remotes::install_github("davidkane9/PPBDS.data")
install.packages("renv")

Because we are still improving **PPBDS.data**, you should re-install it every week or so.

4) At this point, you should have all the tools you need to contribute. If you have never done a pull request, however, you will need to learn more. Start by reading the help page:

https://usethis.r-lib.org/articles/articles/pr-functions.html

Read the whole thing! Don't just skim it. These are important concepts for professional-level workflow. The **usethis** package is mostly providing wrappers around the underlying git commands. If you want to understand what is happening at a lower level, read the next link, but doing so is optional.

https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/GitHub-Contributing-to-a-Project

5) The key steps, which closely follow the **usethis** help page:

a) Fork/download the target repo:  

create_from_github("davidkane9/PPBDS", 
                    fork = TRUE, 
                    destdir = "/Users/dkane/Desktop/projects/", 
                    protocol = "https")
                    
That is the repo for working on the book. If you are working on data or tutorials, you need to fork/download davidkane9/PPBDS.data instead (or in addition to).                     
                    
For your education, it is worth reading the help page for `create_from_github()`. The `fork`  and `protocal` arguments may not really be necessary and, obviously, you should place the project in the location on your computer in which other projects live. The command first forks a copy of PPBDS to your repo and then clone/downloads that fork to your computer. Note that `create_from_github()` can be used with whatever repo you'd like to fork, clone, and download locally.

This may seem like overkill, but, as the SCM book explains, it is how (essentially) all large projects are organized. With luck, you only have to issue this command once. After that, you are always connected, both to your fork and to the main repo. Also, note that, if something ever gets totally messed up on your computer, you can just delete the PPBDS folder on your computer and the repo on Github and then start again. (If you have made changes that you don't want to lose, just save those files to one side and then move them back after you have recreated the project.)

Note that this command should automatically put you in a new RStudio session with the PPBDS project.

b) The next step is to get **renv** setup so that you are running the same package versions as everyone else. You should have already installed the **renv** package, so first run `renv::consent(provided = TRUE)` to allow **renv** to make changes to your packages. Then, run `renv::restore()` to install all the packages used in the book and ensure all your packages are the same version as everyone else. If you end up needing to install a new package --- which should be rare --- just install it and then type `renv::snapshot()`. This will update the renv.lock file with the new package. You just commit and push the bew version of renv.lock, and that shares the information with everyone else on the project.

c) Create a branch to work from:

> pr_init(branch = "chapter-9")

Make sure the branch name is sensible. Again, this is a command that you only need to issue once, at least this summer. (In more professional settings, you will often work on several different branches at once.) You should always be "on" this branch in PPBDS, never on "master". You can check this in the upper right corner.

d) Now you can work like you usually do. Make changes in your file. Knit to make sure they work. Commit with a message. And so on. Now, when working on your own repos, you would also be pushing and pulling regularly as well. Because you are part of a larger project, these commands are slightly different than what you have done before, which has usually just been clicking on the pull/push buttons.

e) Pull regularly:

> pr_pull_upstream()

Issue this command all the time. This is how you make sure that your repo and your computer is updated with the latest changes that have been made in the book. The word "upstream" is associated with davidkane9/PPBDS. The word "origin" is associated with your_github_id/PPBDS. But, in general, you don't need to worry about this. Just pull every time you sit down. (Just clicking the pull button is not enough. That only pulls from your repo, to which no changes have been made. It does not pull from davidkane9/PPBDS.) You issue this command multiple times a day.

f) Issue pull requests every few days, depending on how much work you have done and/or whether other people are waiting for something you have done.

> pr_push().

Again, these commands bundle up a bunch of git commands (which you could do "by hand") into one handy step. This command does everything needed to create a "pull request" --- a request from you to me that I accept the changes you are proposing in davidkane9/PPBDS --- and then opens up the webpage to show you. BUT YOU ARE NOT DONE! You must PRESS the button. Until then, the PR has not actually been created. `pr_push()` just does everything before that. The "pr" in `pr_push()` stands for pull request.

g) I will leave aside for now issues associated with the back-and-forth discussions we might have around your pull request. I will probably just accept it. Your changes will go into davidkane9/PPBDS and then be distributed to everyone else when they run `pr_pull_upstream()`.

h) You can now continue on. There is no need to wait for me to deal with your pull request. There is no need to create another branch, much less to fork/clone/download again. You just keep editing your files, knitting, and committing. When you feel you have completed another chunk of work, just run `pr_push()` again.



## Some Common Problems

0) In the immediate aftermath of this creation process, the blue/green arrows (in the Git panel) for pulling/pushing may be grayed out. This is a sign that the connection between your computer and your forked repo has not "settled in." (I am not sure of the cause or even if this is the right terminology.) I think that just issuing your first `pr_pull_upstream()` fixes it. If not, it always goes away. Until it does, however, you can't pull/push to your repo. That doesn't really matter, however, since the key commands you need are `pr_pull_upstream()` and `pr_push()`, both of which always work immediately.

1) After running `pr_pull_upstream()`, *you will often see a bunch of files in your Git tab in the top right corner of Rstudio* marked with an M (for Modified), including files which you know you did not edit. These are the files that have been updated on the "truth" --- on davidkane9/PPBDS --- since your last `pr_pull_upstream()`. Since you pulled them directly from the original repo, your forked repo sees all the changes other people have made and thinks that YOU MADE THEM. This is easily fixed, however — just commit all the changes to your forked repo. (Strangely, this seems to not always happen. If you don't see this effect, don't worry.)

2) Always run `pr_pull_upstream()` before committing a file you have not edited. Otherwise, you will create lots of merge conflicts. If this happens, save a copy of the file(s) you personally were editing off to the side. Then, delete the project on your computer and the repo on your Github account. Then follow the instructions to set up everything again. Then move in your file(s) by hand, and commit/push them as normal.

3) When you submit a pull request to merge your work with the original repo, it won't always be smiles and sunshine — every once in a while, you'll run into *merge conflicts*. When these arise, it is because two parties (these can be students or Preceptor) work on a file separately and submit conflicting changes. This makes it hard for GitHub to "merge" your version with the other version. When this happens, find multiple adjacent ">", "<", and "=" signs in your document — these will show you where the conflicts occur. Example: 

If you see the above-mentioned conflicts in your document, DO NOT SUBMIT A PULL REQUEST. This will mess things up. First, go through your document, and make sure all the weird conflict indicators (<, >, and =) are removed. The decide what goes in that space. It might be the stuff you write. It might be the other stuff. It might be some combination of the two which you decide on. Whatever happens, you are making an an affirmative choice about what should appear in the file at that location. Then, run `pr_push()` again.

4) `pr_push()` can be tricky. First, note that, if Preceptor has not accepted a (p)ull (r)equest which you have submitted, then your PR is still open. You can see it here: https://github.com/davidkane9/PPBDS/pulls. In fact, you can see all the closed/completed pull requests as well. If, while one PR is still open, you submit another `pr_push()`, then this will just be added to your current PR. And that is OK! We don't need it to be separate. 

But even if there is not an open PR, `pr_push()` can be tricky. The key thing to remember is that *you must press a button on Github* for a new PR to be created. Normally, this is easy. Running pr_push() automatically (or perhaps after you run pr_view()) puts you in a browser and brings you to the correct Github page. Press the button and -- presto! -- you have created a PR. But, sometimes, the webpage is different. It actually sends you back to an old pull request. When this happens, you need to click on the "Pull Request" tab above. This will take you to a new page, with a green button labeled "Compare & Pull Request". Press that button.
