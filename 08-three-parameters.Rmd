# Three Parameters {#three-parameters}

*This chapter is still very much a draft.* Come back in a few weeks for a better version.







<!--   2.1) Wisdom -->

<!--   This section can be rather short. There are two aspects to be discussed: Whether our data is appropriate for answering our research question and whether there are ethical concerns. Stick to the points outlined by Gelman. Begin by discussing possible problems with the data set on hand, in particular the 'age' and 'party' variables. Also consider how other variables might impact the usefulness of these two. Make sure to address both content-related (does this variables tell us what we're looking for?) and methodological problems (is the assignment mechanism problematic, can the scale lead to problems?). This was already discussed on C3, so have a look at this before doing all this from scratch. -->


<!--   2.2) Justice -->

<!--   This section consists of two parts. First, we need to become aware of the purpose of our our model - in this section, it is about making a prediction. Explain why that is, and how this shows in the Preceptor able. Start with and infinite one, then drop any irrelevant rows and columns to arrive at the ideal Preceptor table. Replace unknown rows with question marks to get the actual table. Again, have a look at C3 before doing this. -->
<!--   Second, show the mathematical model. Start by repeating the generic regression equation shown in the math section of C3. Then, write the actual regression equation we will use to create our model in this chapter. Instead of just stopping here like in previous chapters, we will now explain what it actually means. Again, no need to talk about the Bayesian-specific stuff like priors. Start with a scatterplot, then add a regression line. Explain how the stuff in the plot corresponds to the equation. Give some examples. -->


<!--   2.3) Courage -->

<!--   This section consists of two subparts. First, we need to explain the fitted model. Estimate the model shown before using stan_glm().  Then, create a scatterplot with the estimated regression line. Explain the output by referring to the plot.  -->
<!--   Second, explain the unmodeled variation. It is, on average, zero - without this assumption, our model would be useless. Explain why this does not hold for (almost) any individual observation, i.e. what residuals are. Give some examples. Finally, create a histogram each for the distribution of y hat, the two regression coefficients, and the residuals. Arrange them in this very order, and possibly put the regression equation below to show how this relates to the model. -->


<!--   2.4) Temperance -->

<!--   We have three sections here. First, make some predictions using predict(), posterior_predict(), and posterior linpred. Explain what the output means.  -->
<!--   Third, explain why null tests are stupid (why are they?). -->







Models have parameters. In Chapter \@ref(one-parameter) we created models with a single parameter $p$, the proportion of red beads in an urn. In Chapter \@ref(two-parameters) , we used models with two parameters: $\mu$ (the average height in the population, generically known as a model "intercept") and $\sigma$ (the variation in height in the population). Here --- can you guess where this is going? --- we will build models with three parameters: $\sigma$ (which serves the same role throughout the book) and two intercepts: $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$. All this notation is confusing, not least because different academic fields use inconsistent schemes. The key is to just follow the cardinal virtues and tackle your problem step by step.




## EDA for `trains`

<!-- DK: Still need to standardize the method we use for providing references. -->

<!-- DK: Fix Enos reference. -->

As always, it makes sense to start with some exploratory data analysis (EDA). To demonstrate modeling with three parameters, we will use the `trains` data set from the **PPBDS.data** package. Recall the discussion from Chapter \@ref(rubin-causal-model). Enos (2014) randomly placed Spanish-speaking confederates on nine train platforms around Boston, Massachusetts. Exposure to Spanish-speakers -- the `treatment` -- influenced attitudes toward immigration. These reactions were measured through changes in answers to three survey questions. Let's load the libraries we will need in this chapter, all of which we have used before, and look at the data.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(PPBDS.data)
library(rstanarm)
library(broom.mixed)
library(skimr)
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
glimpse(trains)
```

Here, we can see variables that indicate each respondent's gender, political affiliations, age, and income. Additionally, we have variables that indicate whether a subject was in the control or treatment group, and their attitudes toward immigration both before (`att_start`) and after (`att_end`) the experiment. You can type `?trains` to read the help page for more information about each variable. Let's restrict attention to a subset of the variables.

```{r}
ch8 <- trains %>% 
  select(age, att_end, party, treatment)
```

It is always smart to look at a some random samples of the data:

```{r}
ch8 %>% 
  sample_n(5)
```

`att_end` is a measure of person's attitude toward immigration, a higher number means more conservative, i.e., a more exclusionary stance on immigration into the United States. Running `glimpse()` is another way of exploring a data set.

```{r}
ch8 %>% 
  glimpse()
```

Pay attention to the variable types. Do they make sense? Perhaps. But there are certainly grounds for suspicion. Why are `age` and `att_end` doubles rather than integers? All the values in the data appear to be integers, so there is no benefit is having these variables be doubles. Why is `party` a character variable and `treatment` a factor variable? It could be that these are intentional choices made by the creator of the tibble, i.e., us. These could be mistakes. Or, most likely, these choices are a mixture of sensible and arbitrary. Regardless, it is your responsibility to notice them. You can't make a good model without looking closely at the data which you are using.

`skim` from the **skimr** package is the best way to get an overview of a tibble.

```{r}
ch8 %>% 
  skim()
```

`skim()` shows us what the different values of `treatment` are because it is a factor. Unfortunately, it does not do the same for character variables like `party`. The ranges for `age` and `att_end` seem reasonable. Recall that participants were asked three questions about immigration issues, each of which allowed for an answer indicated strength of agreement on a scale form 1 to 5, with higher values indicating more agreement with conservative viewpoints. `att_end` is the sum of the responses to the three questions, so the most liberal possible value is 3 and the most conservative is 15.

Always plot your data.

```{r}
ch8 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = party, y = age)) + 
  geom_jitter(width = 0.1, height = 0) + 
  labs(title = "Age by Party Affiliation in Trains Dataset",
       subtitle = "Where are the old Republicans?",
       x = "Party",
       y = "Age")
```

From this plot, we can gather that there are many more Democrats in this dataset than Republicans. Democrats also span a wider range of ages than Republicans. The mode age for Democrats appears to be 50.

```{r}
ch8 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = treatment, y = att_end)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  labs(title = "Attitude End by Treatment in Trains Dataset",
       subtitle = "Did the treatment make people more conservative?",
       x = "Treatment",
       y = "Attitude After Experiment")
```

On a boxplot, the top and bottom borders of the box denotes the 75th and 25th percentiles, respectively. The line inside the box denotes the mean of the data. Treated individuals have a higher mean `att_end` than the control group, and a higher distribution in general, with its 25th percentile lining up with the mean of the control group. The control group has one outlier, while the treatment group has none. 



## age ~ party


We want to build a model and then use that model to draw conclusions about the world. What is the probability that, if a Democrat shows up at the train station, he will be over 50 years old? In a group of three Democrats and three Republicans, what age difference should we expect between the oldest Democrat and the youngest Republican? We can answer these and similar questions by creating a model that uses party affiliation to predict age

### Wisdom

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.margin=TRUE, fig.cap="Wisdom"}
knitr::include_graphics("other/images/Wisdom.jpg")
```

In data science, there are two main aspects to Wisdom: representativeness and ethics. The data that we have are very limited. There are only 115 observations, all from 2012 and involving train commuters to Boston. How useful will this data be today, or for other populations around Boston, or for other cities in the US? Only your judgment, along with advice from your colleagues, can guide you.

The ethical issues are, fortunately, not fraught. Estimating someone's age is (universally?) viewed as OK. Estimating someone's health or income or criminal record are far dicier. 


### Justice

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.margin=TRUE, fig.cap="Justice"}
knitr::include_graphics("other/images/Justice.jpg")
```

Justice, in data science, consists of three topics: predictive versus causal modeling, the Preceptor Table and a mathematical formulation of the model. 


Any model with age as its dependent variable will be predictive, not causal, for the simple reason that nothing, other than time, can change our age. You are X years old. It would not matter if you changed your party registration from Democrat to Republican or vice versa. Your age is your age.

In terms of the Preceptor Table, this fact means that there is only one potential outcome, i.e., one outcome. There is not a potential outcome if you are Democrat and a different potential outcome if you are a Republican.

When dealing with a non-causal model, the focus is on predicting things. The underlying mechanism which connects age with party is less important than the brute statistical fact that there is a connection.  *Predictive models care little about causality.*

<!-- DK: Really need a Preceptor Table! -->


We now know that we are working with a predictive model. Recall:

$$outcome = model + not\ in\ the\ model$$

In words, any event depends on our explicitly described model as well as on influences unknown to us. Everything that happens in the world is the result of various factors, and we can only ever consider a part of them in our model (because we do not know about some influences, or because we have no data about them).  

So far we have only treated the equation above conceptually, but in fact it works just like any other equation. Let's be a bit more concrete. Our model would formally look like this:

<!-- DK: Should standardize the notation across the book. -->

$$ \underbrace{y_i}_{outcome} = \underbrace{\beta_1 x_{r,i} + \beta_2 x_{d,i}}_{model} + \underbrace{\epsilon_i}_{not\ in\ the\ model}$$

where \n
$$x_{r,i}, x_{d,i} \in \{0,1\}$$ \n
$$x_{r,i} +  x_{d,i} = 1$$ \n
$$\epsilon_i \sim N(0, \sigma^2)$$   

Don't panic dear poets and philosophers, the whole thing is easier than it looks at first sight. 

* On the left-hand side we have the outcome, $y_i$, which is the variable to be explained. In our case, this is the age in years of a person. 

* On the right-hand side we first have the part contained in the model, consisting of two similar looking terms. The two terms stand for Republicans and Democrats and work as follows. Each term consists of a parameter and a data point. The betas are our two parameters; $\beta_1$ is the average age of Republicans in the population and $\beta_2$ is the average age of  Democrats in the population. The x's are our explanatory variables and take the values 1 or 0. If someone is a Republican we have $x_{r,i} = 1$ and $x_{d,i} = 0$, if someone is a Democrat we have $x_{r,i} = 0$ and $x_{d,i} = 1$. In other words, the x's are binary variables and are mutually exclusive (if you are a Democrat, you cannot also be a Republican).

* The last part, $\epsilon_i$ (“epsilon”), represents the unexplained part and is called the error term. It is simply the difference between the outcome and our model predictions. In our particular case, this includes all factors that have an influence on someone's age but are not explained by party affiliation. We assume that this error follows a normal distribution with an expected value of 0, i.e., it is 0 on average.

* The small i's are an index to number observations in our data set. It is equivalent to the "ID" column in our Preceptor Table and simply states that the outcome for person i is explained by the modeled and non-modeled factors for person i. The corresponding x's have an $r$ or $d$ subscript, for Republican or Democrat.



### Courage

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.margin=TRUE, fig.cap="Courage"}
knitr::include_graphics("other/images/Courage.jpg")
```

Courage allows us to translate model to code.


To get posterior distributions for our three parameters, we will again use the `stan_glm()` function from Chapter \@ref(two-parameters). If we take a look at the formula, we can see that it is similar to the equation from before. 

* The variable before the tilde, `age`, is our outcome. 

* The only explanatory variable is `party`. This variable has only two values, 'Democrat' and 'Republican'. 

* We have also added `- 1` at the end of the equation, indicating that we do not want an intercept, which is otherwise added by default. Running this code in R, we get the following output:

```{r}
fit_obj <- stan_glm(age ~ party - 1, data = trains, refresh = 0)

fit_obj
```


"partyDemocrat" corresponds to $\beta_1$, the average age of Democrats in the population. "partyRepublican" corresponds to $\beta_2$, the average age of Republicans in the population. Since we don't really care about the posterior distribution for $\sigma$, we won't discuss it here. Graphically:

<!-- DK: Lots to clean up about this plot! -->

<!-- DK: Should we use different parameter names like beta_r? -->

```{r}
fit_obj %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  select(-sigma) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = partyDemocrat:partyRepublican,
              names_to = "parameter",
              values_to = "age") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = age, color = parameter)) +
    geom_density() +
    labs(title = "Posterior Probability Distribution",
         subtitle = "Average age for Boston commuters in 2012",
         x = "Age",
         y = "Probability") +
    theme_classic()
```

The unknown parameters $\beta_1$ (partyDemocrat) and $\beta_2$ (partyRepublican) are still unknown. We can never know the true average age of all Democrats in the population. But we can calculate a posterior probability distribution for the parameters. Comments:

* Democrats seem slightly older than Republicans. That was true in our sample and so, almost (but not quite!) by definition, it will be true in our the posterior probability distributions.

* Our estimate for the average age of Democrats in the population is much more precise than that for Republicans because we have five times as many Democrats as Republicans in our sample. A central lesson from Chapter \@ref(one-paramter) is that, the more data you have related to a parameter, the narrower your posterior distribution will be.

* There is a great deal of overlap between the two distributions. Would we be surprised if, in truth, the average age of Republicans in the population was greater than that for Democrats? Not really. We don't have enough data to be sure either way.

* The phrase "in the population" is doing a great deal of work because we have not what, precisely, we mean by the population. Is it the set of people on those commuter platforms on those days in 2012 when the experiment was done? Is it the set of people on all platforms, including ones never visited? Is it the set of all Boston commuter? All Massachusetts residents? All US residents? Does it include people today, or can we only draw inferences for 2012? We will explore these questions in every model we create.


```{r, echo = FALSE}
trains %>% 
  select(age, party) %>% 
  mutate(fitted = fitted(fit_obj)) %>% 
  mutate(residual = residuals(fit_obj)) %>% 
  slice(1:8) %>% 
  gt() %>%
  cols_label(age = md("**Age**"),
             party = md("**Party**"),
             fitted = md("**Fitted**"),
             residual = md("**Residual**")) %>%
  fmt_number(columns = vars(fitted), decimals = 2) %>% 
  tab_header("8 Observations from Trains Dataset") %>%
  cols_align(align = "center", columns = TRUE) 


```

The fitted values are the same for all Republicans and for all Democrats, as the fitted value is one of the two estimates output by our model. However, almost all of the residuals are different due to each observation's own variation from the fitted value estimate.  This table shows how just a sample of 8 individuals captures a wide range of residuals, making it difficult to predict the age of a new individual who walks in the room even using our model. 

We can get a better picture of the unmodeled variation in our sample if we plot these three values for all individuals in our data set. The following three histograms show the actual outcomes, fitted values and residuals of all people in `trains`:

<!-- DK: Clean up these plots to be similar across chapters! -->

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align='center'}

trains_both <- trains %>% 
              select(party, age) %>% 
              mutate("fitted" = ifelse(party == "Democrat", 41.1, 42.6),
                     "residual" = age - fitted)



# Actual outcomes (both)

act_both <- ggplot(trains_both, aes(x = age)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", fill = "blueviolet", binwidth = 2, boundary = 20) +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), limits = c(18, 70)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), limits = c(0, 10), breaks = c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10)) +
  labs(
    x = "Age",
    y = "Count") +
  theme_linedraw()


# Predicted outcomes (both)

pred_both <- ggplot(trains_both, aes(x = fitted)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", fill = "blueviolet", binwidth = 1.5) +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), limits = c(18, 70)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), limits = c(0, 100)) +
  labs(
    x = "Fitted Values",
    y = "") +
  theme_linedraw()


# Residuals (both)

res_both <- ggplot(trains_both, aes(x = residual)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", fill = "blueviolet", binwidth = 2) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), limits = c(0, 10), breaks = c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10)) +
  labs(
    x = "Residuals",
    y = "") +
  theme_linedraw()

act_both + pred_both + res_both + 
  plot_annotation(title = "Results for Democrats and Republicans")

```

The three plots are structured like our equation and table above, i.e. a value in the left plot is the addition of one value in the middle and one in the right plot. The actual age distribution looks like a normal distribution, centered around 43 and with a standard deviation of about 12 years. The plot for the fitted values shows only two adjacent spikes, which represent the estimates for Democrats and Republicans. Since the residuals represent the difference between the two plots, their distribution looks like the first plot. 

<!-- DK: All unclear and would benefit from clean up. -->


### Temperance

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.margin=TRUE, fig.cap="Temperance"}
knitr::include_graphics("other/images/Temperance.jpg")
```

Recall the first questions with which we began this section:

* What is the probability that, if a Democrat shows up at the train station, he will be over 50 years old? 

So far we have only tried our model on people from our data set whose real age we already knew. This is helpful to understand the model, but our ultimate goal is to understand more about the real world, about people we don't yet know much about. Temperance guides us to make meaningful predictions and to become aware of their known and unknown limitations.


We learned in Chapter \@ref(two-parameters) that, when running `stan_glm`, an algorithm creates thousands of simulations, each of which contains a draw from the posterior distribution of each parameter. . 

What sounds complicated is actually just a matter of a few extra lines of code. To start with a simple question, what are the chances that a random Democrat is over 50 years old? First, we create a tibble with the desired input for our model. In our case the tibble has a column named "party" which contains a single observation named "Democrat". This is a bit different than before, when we only specified the input to be 0 or 1. Next, we'll use the `posterior_predict()` function to get some simulation results. `posterior_predict()` takes two arguments: the model for which the simulations should be run, and a tibble indicating for which and how many parameters we want to run these simulations. In this case, the model is the one from 'Courage' and the tibble is the one we just created.

```{r}
# Creating a tibble with a column named "party" and a single observation,
# "Democrat". We will use this to tell posterior_predict() that we want
# simulation results for a single Democrat.

new <- tibble(party = "Democrat")

# Generating simulation results. The first argument specifies the fitted model
# to be used, which in our case is the one we generated in "Courage". The second
# argument specifies the input.

pp <- posterior_predict(fit_obj, newdata = new)

head(pp, 10)

```

A look at the first few observations shows that we simply get ten draws from the model's posterior distribution of the age of a Democrat. It is important to understand that this is not a concrete person from the `trains` dataset - the algorithm in `posterior_predict()` simply uses the existing data from  `trains` to estimate this posterior distribution. 

Note that we have a new posterior distribution under consideration here. The unknown parameter, call it $D_{age}$ is the age of a Democrat. This could be the age of a randomly selected Democrat from the population or of the next Democrat we meet or of the next Democrat we interview on the train platform. The definition of "population" determines the appropriate interpretation. Yet, regardless, $D_{age}$ is an unknown parameter, not one, like $\beta_1$,  $\beta_2$, or $\sigma$ that we have already estimated. That is why we need `posterior_predict()`.


```{r}
tibble(age = pp[, 1]) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = age)) +
    geom_density() +
    labs(title = "Posterior Probability Distribution for a Democrat's Age",
         x = "Age",
         y = "Probability") +
    theme_linedraw()

```

Once we have the posterior distribution, we can answer (almost) any reasonable question. In this case, the probability that the next Democrat will be over 50 is around 28%.

```{r}
tibble(age = pp[, 1]) %>% 
  mutate(ot_50 = ifelse(age > 50, TRUE, FALSE)) %>% 
  summarize(perc = sum(ot_50)/n())
```

Recall the second question:

* In a group of three Democrats and three Republicans, what age difference should we expect between the oldest Democrat and the youngest Republican?

As before we start by creating a tibble with the desired input. Note that the name of the column ("party") and the observations ("Democrat", "Republican") must always be *exactly* as they the data set. This tibble as well as our model can then be used as arguments for `posterior_predict()`:

```{r}

new <- tibble(party = c("Democrat", "Democrat", "Democrat", 
                        "Republican", "Republican","Republican"))

set.seed(27)
pp <- posterior_predict(fit_obj, newdata = new)

head(pp, 10)

```

<!-- DK: These pp objects are fundamentally flawed because some of the predicted values are absurdly low, even negative! This is not the fault of the model or the code. It is simply that the sigma is large enough, then the model things a negative age is plausible. We should at least mention this, ideally as part of a posterior predictive check, perhaps in a problem set. -->

A look at the output shows that we now have 6 columns: one for each person. R does not name the columns, but they are arranged in the same order in which we specified the persons in the tibble (D, D, R, R, R). Notice that all values in a row belong to the same scenario, i.e. each row represents a scenario where the 6 people meet. 

To determine the expected age difference, we can then proceed as follows:

<!-- DK: I am unsure about this code. Would c() in place of c_across() work as well? -->

<!-- DK: This works, but it takes much more time than it should because the the pp object still has every column as a ppd object, even after as_tibble(). The rest of the code still works, but takes a 100x longer than it should. Maybe this is the best approach for handling the ppd problem? Just ignore it and take the time hit? -->


```{r}

as_tibble(pp) %>% 
  set_names(c("dem_1", "dem_2", "dem_3", 
              "rep_1", "rep_2", "rep_3")) %>% 
  rowwise() %>% 
  
  # Creating three new columns. The first two are the 
  # highest age among Democrats and the lowest age
  # among Republicans, respectively. The third one is
  # the difference between the first two.
  
  mutate(dems_oldest = max(c_across(dem_1:dem_3)),
         reps_youngest = min(c_across(rep_1:rep_3)),
         age_diff = dems_oldest - reps_youngest) %>% 
  
  # Ungroup to tell R not to perform rowwise operations
  # anymore.
  
  ungroup() %>% 
  
  # Create posterior probability distribution
  
  ggplot(aes(x = age_diff)) +
    geom_density() +
    labs(title = "Posterior Probability Distribution",
         subtitle = "Age difference between the oldest/youngest of three Democrats/Republicans",
         x = "Age",
         y = "Probability")
  
```

In words, we would expect the oldest Democrat to be about 22 years older than the youngest Republican, but we would not be surprised if the oldest Democrat were actually younger than the youngest Republican.




## att_end ~ treatment

Above, we created a predictive model: with someone's party affiliation, we can make a better guess as to what their age is then what we could have in the absence of information about their age. There was nothing causal about that model. Changing someone's party registration can not change their age. In this example, we build a causal model. What is the average treatment effect, of exposing people to Spanish-speakers, on their attitudes toward immigration? What is the largest causal effect which still has a 1 in 10 chance of occurring?


### Wisdom

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.margin=TRUE, fig.cap="Wisdom"}
knitr::include_graphics("other/images/Wisdom.jpg")
```

We are still using the data from Enos (2014). Yet the world is a very different place today! Is data from 2012, four years before Donald Trump's election as president, still relevant to understanding the world today? Can we generalize data from Boston commuters to other people in Massachusetts, to other people in the US? There are no obvious the answers to these questions. *The data we have is never a perfect match to the problem we face because data is always old.* The world is constantly changing. To use old data, we need to make assumptions about the stability of our model of the world and of the parameters we are estimating. Whether those assumptions are reasonable is a difficult question, one that requires knowledge about the world as it was and the world as it now is. Math won't save us.

Ethical issues are tricky, or at least trickier than they were in the context of models in which the dependent variable was height or age. (And then ethical issues in conducting the experiment in the first place are non-trivial.) Assume we make a good model. What is to prevent someone from using that information to, say, influence voting and donations? Imagine a Republican Senate candidate who hires Spanish-speakers to ride commuter trains in order to shift voters' attitudes toward immigration in a conservative direction. She believes (correctly?) that doing so will increase her odds of winning the election. Is that the sort of knowledge we seek to create? We can make such models. Indeed, the purpose of this chapter is to show you how to do so! But should you make those models?

### Justice

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.margin=TRUE, fig.cap="Justice"}
knitr::include_graphics("other/images/Justice.jpg")
```

The three elements of Justice in data science remain the same: predictive/causal models, Preceptor Table, and mathematical formula.


The math for this model is exactly the same as the math for the predictive model in the first half of the chapter, although we change the notation a bit for clarity.

$$ \underbrace{y_i}_{outcome} = \underbrace{\beta_1 x_{t,i} + \beta_2 x_{c,i}}_{model} + \underbrace{\epsilon_i}_{not\ in\ the\ model}$$

where \n
$$x_{t,i}, x_{c,i} \in \{0,1\}$$ \n
$$x_{t,i} +  x_{c,i} = 1$$ \n
$$\epsilon_i \sim N(0, \sigma^2)$$  

Nothing has changed, except for the meaning of the data items and the interpretations of the parameters. 

* On the left-hand side we have the outcome, $y_i$, which is the variable to be explained. In our case, this is a person's attitude toward immigration after the experiment is complete.  $y_i$ takes on integer values between 3 and 15 inclusive.

* On the right-hand side we first have the part contained in the model, consisting of two similar looking terms. The two terms stand for Treated and Control and work as follows. Each term consists of a parameter and a data point. The betas are our two parameters. $\beta_1$ is the average attitude toward immigration for treated individuals --- those exposed to Spanish-speakers ---   in the population. $\beta_2$ is the average attitude toward immigration for control individuals --- those not exposed to Spanish-speakers ---  in the population. The x's are our explanatory variables and take the values 1 or 0. If someone is a Treated we have $x_{t,i} = 1$ and $x_{c,i} = 0$, if someone is a Control we have $x_{t,i} = 0$ and $x_{c,i} = 1$. In other words, the x's are binary variables and are mutually exclusive (if you are a Treated, you cannot also be a Control).

* The last part, $\epsilon_i$ (“epsilon”), represents the unexplained part and is called the error term. It is simply the difference between the outcome and our model predictions. In our particular case, this includes all factors that have an influence on someone's attitude toward immigration but are not explained by treatment status. We assume that this error follows a normal distribution with an expected value of 0, i.e., it is 0 on average.

* The small i's are an index to number observations in our data set. It is equivalent to the "ID" column in our Preceptor Table and simply states that the outcome for person i is explained by the modeled and non-modelled factors for person i. The corresponding x's have a $t$ or $c$ subscript, for Treated or Control.


### Courage

knitr::include_graphics("other/images/Courage.jpg")
```

With Justice satisfied, we gather our Courage and fit the model. Note that, except for the change in variable names, the code is exactly the same as it was above, in our predictive model for age. *Predictive models and causal models use the same math and the same code.* The differences, and they are very important, lie in the interpretation of the results, not in their creation. 

```{r}
set.seed(9)
fit_obj <- stan_glm(att_end ~ treatment - 1, data = trains, refresh = 0)

fit_obj
```

treatmentTreated corresponds to $\beta_1$. As always, R has estimated the entire posterior probability distribution for $\beta_1$ behind the scenes. We will graph that distribution in the next section. But the basic print method for these objects can't show the entire distribution, so it gives us to summary numbers: the median and the MAD SD. Speaking roughtly, we would expect about 95% of the values in the posterior to be with two MAD SD's of the median. In other words, we are 95% confident that the true, but unknowable, average attitude toward immigration among the Treated in the population to be between 9.2 and 10.8. 

treatmentControl corresponds to $\beta_2$. The same analysis applies. We are about 95% confident that the true value for the average attitude toward immigration for Control in the population is between 7.9 and 9.1. 

Up until now, we have used the Bayesian interpretation of "confidence interval." This is also the intuitive meaning which, outside of academia, is almost universal. There is a truth out there. We don't know, and sometimes can't know, the truth. A confidence interval, and its associated confidence level, tells us how likely the truth is to lie within a specific range. If your boss asks you for a confidence interval, she almost certainly is using this interpretation.

But, in contemporary academic research, the phrase "confidence interval" is usually given a "Frequentist" interpretation. (The biggest divide in statistics is between Bayesians and Frequentist interpretations. The Frequentist approach, also known as "Classical" statistics, has been dominant for 100 years. Its power is fading, which is why this textbook uses the Bayesian approach. For a Frequentist, a 95% confidence interval means that, if we were to apply the procedure we used in an infintite number of future situations like this, we would expect the true value to fall within the calculated confidence intervals 95% of the time. In academia, a distinction is sometimes made between confidence intervals (which use the Frequentist interpretation) and credible intervals (which use the Bayesian interpretation). We won't worry about that difference in this book.

<!-- DK: Does using geom_density() really allow us to label the y-axis as "Probability"? -->

Let's look at the entire posteriors for both $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$.

```{r}
fit_obj %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  select(-sigma) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = treatmentTreated:treatmentControl,
              names_to = "parameter",
              values_to = "attitude") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = attitude, color = parameter)) +
    geom_density() +
    labs(title = "Posterior Probability Distribution",
         subtitle = "Average attitude toward immigration",
         x = "Attitude",
         y = "Probability") +
    theme_classic()
```

It appears that the affect of the treatment is to change people's attitudes to be more conservative about immigration issues. Which is somewhat surprising!

We can decompose the the dependent variable, `att_end` into two parts: the fitted values and the residuals. There are only two possible fitted values, one for the Treated and one for the Control. The residuals, as always, are simply the difference between the outcomes and the fitted values. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
outcome <- trains %>% 
  ggplot(aes(att_end)) +
    geom_histogram(bins = 10) +
    labs(x = "Attitude toward Immigration",
         y = "Count") 

fitted <- tibble(height = fitted(fit_obj)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(height)) +
    geom_bar(width = 0.2) +
    labs(x = "Fitted Values",
         y = NULL) +
    scale_x_continuous(limits = c(3.5, 15),
                       breaks = c(4, 8, 12))

res <- tibble(resids = residuals(fit_obj)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(resids)) +
    geom_histogram(bins = 10) +
    labs(x = "Residuals",
         y = NULL) 
  

outcome + fitted + res +
  plot_annotation(title = "Decomposition of Immigration Attitudes into Fitted Values and Residuals")
```

The smaller the spread of the residuals, the better a job the model is doing of explaining the outcomes.

### Temperance

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.margin=TRUE, fig.cap="Temperance"}
knitr::include_graphics("other/images/Temperance.jpg")
```

Recall the first question with which we began this section:

* What is the average treatment effect, of exposing people to Spanish-speakers, on their attitudes toward immigration? 

Recall from Chapter \@ref(rubin-causal-model) the discussion of the *average treatment effect*. One simple estimator of the average treatment effect is the difference between $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$. After all, the definition of $\beta_1$ is the average attitude toward immigration of the population for those exposed to the treatment. So, $\beta_1 - \beta_2$ is the average treatment effect for the population, roughly 1.5. However, estimating the posterior probability distribution for this parameter is tricky, unless we make use of the posterior distributions of $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$. With that information, the problem is simple:

```{r}
set.seed(14)
fit_obj %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  mutate(ate = treatmentTreated - treatmentControl) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = ate)) +
    geom_density() +
    labs(title = "Posterior Probability Distribution for ATE",
         subtitle = "Exposure to Spanish-speakers shifts immigration attitudes rightward",
         x = "Difference in Attitude",
         y = "Probability") +
    theme_classic()
```

Could the true value of the average treatment effect be as much as 2 or as little as 1? Of course! The most likely value is around 1.5, but the variation in the data and the smallness of our sample cause of estimate to be imprecise. However, it is quite unlikely that the true average treatment effect is below zero.

<!-- DK: Much more discussion. Explain what a test might be used for in this situation and why we should reject testing. -->

Our second question: What is the largest effect size which still has a 1 in 10 chance of occurring? Consider the result of posterior_predict() for someone treated and someone in the control group.


```{r}
# newdata variables must be exactly the same as their counterparts in the
# original data. treatment must be a factor, with the same levels as it has in
# `trains`.

ate_data <- tibble(treatment =
                     factor(c("Treated", "Control"),
                            levels = c("Treated", "Control")))

pp <- posterior_predict(fit_obj, newdata = ate_data)


te <- tibble(Treated = pp[, 1], Control = pp[, 2])  %>% 
  mutate(te = Treated - Control) 

te %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = te)) +
    geom_density() +
    labs(title = "Posterior Probability Distribution for Treatment Effect",
         subtitle = "Causal effects are more variable for indivduals",
         x = "Difference in Attitude",
         y = "Probability") +
    theme_classic()
  
```


In this case, we are looking at the distribution of the treatment effect for a single individual. This is very different than the *average* treatment effect. In particular, it is much more variable. We are looking at one row in the Preceptor Table. For a single individual, the `att_end` value can be anywhere from 3 to 15, both under treatment and under control. So, the causual effect --- the difference between the two potential outcomes can, in theory, be anywhere from -12 to +12. Such extreme values are rare, but not impossible.

The question, however, was interested in the value at the 90th percentile. For this model, that is `r quantile(te$te, prob = 0.9)`. We would not expect a treatment effect of this magnitude to be common, but, at the same time, effects this big and bigger will occur about 10% of the time.
