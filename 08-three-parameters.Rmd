# Three Parameters {#three-parameters}

*This chapter is still very much a draft.* Come back in a few weeks for a better version.


<!-- CHAPTER OUTLINE



0) Intro

Write something interesting that relates to what we want to find out in the chapter. Should build up, but be different from C7. Tell people that we will draw lines between what we learned so far.


1) EDA for trains

[Complete]


2) age ~ party

This is a predictive model. Make this clear from the beginning, and tell people that we will look at a causal one afterwards. 


  2.1) Wisdom
  
  This section can be rather short. There are two aspects to be discussed: Whether our data is appropriate for answering our research question, and whether our estimand is. Stick to the points outlined by Gelman. Begin by discussing possible problems with the data set on hand, in particular the 'age' and 'party' variables. Also consider how other variables might impact the usefulness of these two. Make sure to address both content-related (does this variables tell us what we're looking for?) and methodological problems (is the assignment mechanism problematic, can the scale lead to problems?). This was already discussed on C3, so have a look at this before doing all tjis from scratch.
 Next, make clear what our estimand will be and repeat the same steps. If there have already been problems with the   data, explain how this might affect our estimand. 

  
  2.2) Justice
  
  This section consists of two parts. First, we need to become aware of the purpose of our our model - in this section, it is about making a prediction. Explain why that is, and how this shows in the Preceptor able. Start with and infinite one, then drop any irrelevant rows and columns to arrive at the ideal Preceptor table. Replace unknown rows with question marks to get the actual table. Again, have a look at C3 before doing this.
  Second, show the mathematical model. Start by repeating the generic regression equation shown in the math section of C3. Then, write the actual regression equation we will use to create our model in this chapter. Instead of just stopping here like in previous chapters, we will now explain what it actually means. Again, no need to talk about the Bayesian-specific stuff like priors. Start with a scatterplot, then add a regression line. Explain how the stuff in the plot corresponds to the equation. Give some examples.
  
  
  2.3) Courage
  
  This section consists of two subparts. First, we need to explain the fitted model. Estimate the model shown before using stan_glm(). Don'† forget to use tidy() at the end to add confidence intervals. Then, create a scatterplot with the estimated regression line. Explain the output by referring to the plot. 
  Second, explain the unmodeled variation. It is, on average, zero - without this assumption, our model would be useless. Explain why this does not hold for (almost) any individual observation, i.e. what residuals are. Give some examples. Finally, create a histogram each for the distribution of y hat, the two regression coefficients, and the residuals. Arrange them in this very order, and possibly put the regression equation below to show how this relates to the model.
  
  
  2.4) Temperance
  
  We have three sections here. First, make some predictions using predict(), posterior_predict(), and posterior linpred. Explain what the output means. 
  Second, give examples for why the representativeness of our model might not be what it seems. Ideally, we should have already checked at the beginning that our data is appropriate for our purposes. Therefore, this point rather refers to representativeness over time. Give examples of what we can and cannot do.
  Third, explain why null tests are stupid (why are they?).
  
  

3) att_end ~ treatment

Simply repeat the stuff from above, this time using a causal model. Keep it as simple as possible, there is no need to explain every concept in detail again.

<!-- THINGS TO CONSIDER

Don’t use or mention lm(), only use stan_glm(). Also, don’t mention prior distributions/likelihood functions, since technical details are not really important in practice. This will be left to Gov 51. As a result, we will not adjust the prior arguments within stan_glm(), i.e. all our models are based on the (weak) default prior.

Create some memes. Any way to add Batman to Justice section?

-->

In the last two chapters we have dealt with different aspects of models in detail. In chapter 6 we have played around with a lot with beads in an urn and got to know the first parameter, the variability of our results (sigma). However, due to the simplicity of this chapter, we have not yet used functions in R to estimate our model. In chapter 7 we added the intercept as second parameter, where we first estimated a model in R using `stan_glm()`. But this model was still very simple, because an important part was missing.

In this chapter we will get to know a third parameter, the so-called slope parameter.  This allows us to determine models which can indicate changes in values of variables. Don't worry if this sounds a bit vague. By the end of the chapter you will not only know how to estimate and interpret linear models in R, the concepts from chapter 6 and 7 will also make more sense. This is the last new core concept in this book, all remaining chapters are only about increasing the complexity of our models.


## EDA for `trains`

<!-- DK: Still need to standardize the method we use for providing references. -->

As always, it makes sense to start with some exploratory data analysis (EDA). To demonstrate modeling with three parameters, we will use the `trains` data set from the **PPBDS.data** package. Recall the discussion from Chapter \@ref(rubin-causal-model). Enos (2014) randomly placed Spanish-speaking confederates on nine train platforms around Boston, Massachusetts. Exposure to Spanish-speakers -- the `treatment` -- influenced attitudes toward immigration. These reactions were measured through changes in answers to three survey questions. Let's load the libraries we will need in this chapter, all of which we have used before, and look at the data.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(PPBDS.data)
library(rstanarm)
library(broom.mixed)
library(skimr)
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
glimpse(trains)
```

Here, we can see variables that indicate each respondent's gender, political affiliations, age, and income. Additionally, we have variables that indicate whether a subject was in the control or treatment group, and their attitudes toward immigration both before (`att_start`) and after (`att_end`) the experiment. You can type `?trains` to read the help page for more information about each variable. Let's restrict attention to a subset of the variables.

```{r}
ch8 <- trains %>% 
  select(age, att_end, party, treatment)
```

It is always smart to look at a some random samples of the data:

```{r}
ch8 %>% 
  sample_n(5)
```

`att_end` is a measure of person's attitude toward immigration, a higher number means more conservative, i.e., a more exclusionary stance on immigration into the United States. Running `glimpse()` is another way of exploring a data set.

```{r}
ch8 %>% 
  glimpse()
```

Pay attention to the variable types. Do they make sense? Perhaps. But there are certainly grounds for suspicion. Why are `age` and `att_end` doubles rather than integers? All the values in the data appear to be integers, so there is no benefit is having these variables be doubles. Why is `party` a character variable and `treatment` a factor variable? It could be that these are intentional choices made by the creator of the tibble, i.e., us. These could be mistakes. Or, most likely, these choices are a mixture of sensible and arbitrary. Regardless, it is your responsibility to notice them. You can't make a good model without looking closely at the data which you are using.

`skim` from the **skimr** package is the best way to get an overview of a tibble.

```{r}
ch8 %>% 
  skim()
```

`skim()` shows us what the different values of `treatment` are because it is a factor. Unfortunately, it does not do the same for character variables like `party`. The ranges for `age` and `att_end` seem reasonable. Recall that participants were asked three questions about immigration issues, each of which allowed for an answer indicated strength of agreement on a scale form 1 to 5, with higher values indicating more agreement with conservative viewpoints. `att_end` is the sum of the responses to the three questions, so the most liberal possible value is 3 and the most conservative is 15.

Always plot your data.

```{r}
ch8 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = party, y = age)) + 
  geom_jitter(width = 0.1, height = 0) + 
  labs(title = "Age by Party Affiliation in Trains Dataset",
       subtitle = "Where are the old Republicans?",
       x = "Party",
       y = "Age")
```

From this plot, we can gather that there are many more Democrats in this dataset than Republicans. Democrats also span a wider range of ages than Republicans. The mode age for Democrats appears to be 50.

```{r}
ch8 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = treatment, y = att_end)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  labs(title = "Attitude End by Treatment in Trains Dataset",
       subtitle = "Did the treatment make people more conservative?",
       x = "Treatment",
       y = "Attitude After Experiment")
```

On a boxplot, the top and bottom borders of the box denotes the 75th and 25th percentiles, respectively. The line inside the box denotes the mean of the data. Treated individuals have a higher mean `att_end` than the control group, and a higher distribution in general, with its 25th percentile lining up with the mean of the control group. The control group has one outlier, while the treatment group has none. 




## `age` as a function of `party`

We want to build a predictive model and then use that model to draw conclusions about the world. What are the odds that, if a Republican and Democrat show up at the train station, their ages will be at least 5 years apart? We can answer this and similar questions by creating a model that uses party affiliation to predict someone's age, again following our four key themes.


### Wisdom

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.margin=TRUE, fig.cap="Wisdom"}
knitr::include_graphics("other/images/Wisdom.jpg")
```

Before we write any line of code, the first thing we should do is make it clear that our approach is correct. As already seen in other chapters, there are two aspects to clarify. First, is the data suitable to answer our question? And second, is our estimand appropriate?

First, let's clarify what we want to know. The goal is to find out what age we can expect to find among people of a certain party affiliation. Let's assume we don't want to limit ourselves to people in a certain place, but we are interested in an estimate for the whole USA. As far as party affiliation is concerned, we will probably only want to consider Democrats or Republicans. Returning to the first point, is our data suitable to answer our question? `trains' includes a variable `age' which indicates the age of a person in years, and a variable `party' with values 'Democrat' or 'Republican' which shows their party affiliation. In terms of content this seems to be exactly what we are looking for. Methodologically, however, there could be problems. The data from this study only come from Boston, so the question arises whether we can really draw conclusions for the whole country. In 2018, the median age was 38.8 years in the USA, but 39.4 years in Massachusetts. Although the difference is small, we do not know whether this also applies to Democrats and Republicans separately. Another problem could arise from the fact that Massachusetts (and Boston as an urban area) is very Democratic. As noted earlier, the party affiliates in 'trains' are indeed very unequally distributed:

```{r}
table(trains$party)
```

With 96 Democrats we could already determine an acceptable estimate of the median age. The sample of 19 Republicans is very small in comparison, and hence more prone to errors. Perhaps Enos happened to catch some Republicans in his study who are significantly younger than the rest? If so, our estimate may not even be representative of Massachusetts. 

Overall, there seem to be potential sources of error in our data, but that doesn't necessarily mean that our estimates will be useless in answering our question. In fact, we will rarely have perfect data sets in which all eventualities have been considered. Our job as data scientists is to apply wisdom to recognize the strengths and weaknesses of our data.

What about the second aspect, the Estimand? Before we discuss whether it can answer our question, it is worth thinking again about what the estimand actually is. First of all, remember that an Estimand is the size we are looking for. We want to determine the body heights of two different groups, so in our model we are looking for two Estimands. So far, so good. It might now make sense to define

$$Estimand_{1} = MedianHeightDems$$
$$Estimand_{2} = MedianHeightReps$$

but that is **wrong**! Instead, our estimands look like this:


$$Estimand_{1} = MedianHeightDems$$
$$Estimand_{2} = (MedHeightReps - MedHeightDems)$$
The second estimand is therefore not just the median height of the Republicans, but the *difference* between the median heights of the two groups. You can see very quickly that this gives us exactly the things we want. If we want to have an estimate for a random Democrat, we take estimand 1; if we want to have an estimate for a random Republican, we simply add estimand 2 to estimand 1. Why the effort, when you could simply calculate the values directly? This has to do with how we build regression models, and will make more sense in a few minutes.

Now that we know our estimands, are they suitable to answer our question? The two estimands give us exactly what we want to know, namely the body sizes for members of both parties - so yes. However, they are based on our data set, so there are the same possible sources of error as before. For example, if Enos surveyed too many young Republicans, then estimand 2 would be too low. But again, small inaccuracies are usually not a problem as long as we apply Wisdom and become aware of them.


### Justice

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.margin=TRUE, fig.cap="Justice"}
knitr::include_graphics("other/images/Justice.jpg")
```

We have made sure that the data and the estimands are suitable to answer our question. These are the building blocks of our model, and the next step is to investigate whether the model itself is adequate. This involves deciding between prediction and causality, and defining the formal mathematical model.


#### Prediction vs Causality

Are we modeling for prediction or causality? Recall that in a predictive model we are only interested in getting an estimate of Y for any X. The focus is on predicting things - how exactly this happens is not so important to us. If you have headaches and are thinking about taking aspirin, you would probably be interested in a predictive model. You are not really interested in the relationship between an aspirin dose and headaches, but rather how strong your headache is once you take it. *Predictive models care nothing about causality.*

A causal model, on the other hand, is primarily concerned with the relationship between X and Y themselves. Suppose you work for Pfizer and have discovered a new headache drug that could make billions if approved. However, this requires many studies to get a reliable estimate of which dosage has which effect on humans. Here we are interested in a Model for Causality, because we (primarily) want to know the effect of the drug. We are less interested in the extent of headache that a random person has after taking the drug. *Causal models often also deal with prediction, even if only as a means of measuring the quality of the model.* 

Kommen wir nun zu unserem Modell zum Alter von Demokraten und Republikanern zurück. Es ist recht klar, dass wir hier ein predictive model haben. Was wir haben wollen ist eine Schätzung des Alters einer zufälligen Person, deren Parteizugehörigkeit wir kennen. Es macht nicht viel Sinn, nach dem kausalen Zusammenhang zwischen Parteizugehörigkeit und Körpergröße zu fragen, z.B. "Wenn Joe Republikaner wählen würde, dann wäre er um 4 Jahre jünger". Someone's age is the same regardless of the party of which they are a member. The whole thing becomes clearer if we present our model in a Preceptor Table:



```{r, echo = FALSE}

# Using real sampled ages but making my own tibble

tibble(subject = c("1", "2", "...", "55", "...", "204", "205", "...", "1,627", "...", "N"),
       age = c("34", "?", "...", "36", "...", "44", "?",  "...", "50", "...", "?"),
       party = c("Republican", "?", "...", "Democrat", "...", "Democrat", "?",  "...", "Republican", "...", "?")) %>%
  gt() %>%
  cols_label(subject = md("**ID**"),
             age = md("**Age**"),
             party = md("**Party**")) %>%
  tab_style(cell_borders(sides = "right"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject))) %>%
  cols_align(align = "center", columns = TRUE) %>%
  tab_header("Preceptor Table of age ~ party") %>%
  fmt_markdown(columns = TRUE)

```

The purpose of a Preceptor Table is to capture all of the data such that if the question marks were filled out, one wouldn't need to construct a model. The rows in this Preceptor Table represent the N commuters on which our model is extrapolating, with N being the population of commuters using Boston public transportation. Only 115 of these commuters had their data recorded in the experiment, which is why most observations lack data. 

This table is very simple, which is the point. There is no causal effect as we are simply trying to predict the immutable variable of age. Rather than representing unknown causal effects as they may in other Preceptor Tables, the question marks in this table simply denote missing data. 


#### The mathematical model

$$ y_i = b_1 x_r + b_2 x_d $$
You couldn't know the true value of our parameters ($b_1$ and $b_2$) unless you surveyed every single commuter in the station. This is why we use models to give us estimates. A hat denotes a number that is constant and no longer variable. Because we have estimates for our parameters, $\hat{b_1}$ and $\hat{b_1}$ are denoted by hats. With these numbers plugged in, you determine a singular y value (age) for each observation, thus the denotation  $\hat{y_i}$. This is called the *fitted value*. 

$$ \hat{y_i} = \hat{b_1} x_r + \hat{b_2} x_d  $$
The equation is not finished yet! 

$$\epsilon_i = y_i - \hat{y_i}$$
Adding this together gives:

$$ y_i = \hat{b_1}x_r + \hat{b_2} x_d + \epsilon_i $$





### Courage

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.margin=TRUE, fig.cap="Courage"}
knitr::include_graphics("other/images/Courage.jpg")
```


#### The fitted model

```{r}
obj <- stan_glm(age ~ party, data = trains, refresh = 0)

obj
```

To continue our discussion of these values, we'll bring back our table. We'll display a few specific observations (all of which had their data recorded) rather than representing all N commuters.

```{r, include = FALSE}
margin_note("Note that this is no longer considered a Preceptor Table by our terminology. A Preceptor Table must account for all of the observations in the real-world population that the model is.")

```

This time, we'll include each individual's fitted value for age from our model. We'll also include their residual.  Remember that the actual age of each observation, $y_i$, is the addition of the model's prediction (the fitted value) and real-world noise (the residual). 

```{r, echo = FALSE}

tibble(subject = c("4", "5,051", "76", "80,050", "578", "23", "9,088", "888"),
       party = c("Democrat", "Republican", "Democrat", "Democrat", "Republican", "Democrat", "Republican", "Democrat"),
       age = c(31, 34, 63, 45, 55, 53, 24, 45),
       fitted = c(42.6, 41.1, 42.6, 42.6, 41.1, 42.6, 41.1, 42.6)) %>%
  mutate(noise = fitted - age) %>%
  gt() %>%
  cols_label(subject = md("**ID**"),
             age = md("**$$y_i$$**"),
             party = md("**Party**"),
             fitted = md("**fitted**"),
             noise = md("**residual**")) %>%
  tab_style(cell_borders(sides = "right"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject))) %>%
  tab_header("8 Observations from Trains Dataset") %>%
  cols_align(align = "center", columns = TRUE) %>%
  fmt_markdown(columns = TRUE)

```

The fitted values are the same for all Republicans and for all Democrats, as the fitted value is one of the two estimates output by our model. However, almost all of the residuals are different due to each observation's own variation from the fitted value estimate. The only observations with the same residual are 80,050 and 888. This is because they are both Democrats that are the same age: with the same $y_i$ and $\hat{y_i}$, the calculation of their epsilon values are identical. This table shows how just a sample of 8 individuals captures a wide range of residuals, making it difficult to predict the age of a new individual who walks in the room even using our model.

```{r, include = FALSE}
margin_note("Note that this is no longer considered a Preceptor Table by our terminology. A Preceptor Table must account for all of the observations in the real-world population that the model is.")

```



#### Unmodeled variation

How uncertain are our estimates for age? Again, we use the same tools we have used before:

```{r}
trains %>% 
  lm(data = ., age ~ party - 1) %>% 
  tidy(conf.int = TRUE) %>% 
  select(term, conf.low, estimate, conf.high)
```

The confidence intervals that we've generated display the upper and lower bounds of the mean age of Democrat and Republican commuters on this train platform. This touches on the idea of **parameter uncertainty**: even if a model is constructed in a logical way, we are unable to know our parameters exactly, the parameters in this case being the mean ages of the two parties. Confidence intervals are one way to capture this uncertainty, so that we don't over-confidently put forward one value rather than a range. 

```{r}
trains %>%
  group_by(party) %>%
  summarise(n())
```

You may notice how the range of the confidence interval for Republicans is larger. This may be because far fewer Republicans were surveyed than Democrats -- 19 to 96. Parameter estimates are always exclusively based on the data that the model is fed, so factors like sample size can impact our parameter uncertainty. With more data to work with, we can more accurately capture the true mean age of the Democrat commuters. 



If a new Democrat entered the train station, how easy would it be to guess their age with our model? Could you confidently say that they would be within the Democrat interval bounds of 40 and 45?

$$ y_i = b_0 + b_1 x_i + \epsilon_i $$
One shouldn't be too confident in that prediction. As discussed, the new Democrat's age comes in two parts: the beta (determined by their political party) and their residual (how much noise there is in this observation that offsets it from the beta prediction). While the beta values have been determined by our model, the epsilon value represents *unmodeled variation* that could likely put the value outside of these bounds. Our previous example showed us how just a randomly selected handful can have greatly varying residuals due to the real-world variation that is not captured by the model.



### Temperance

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.margin=TRUE, fig.cap="Temperance"}
knitr::include_graphics("other/images/Temperance.jpg")
```




#### Making Predictions



#### Unknown unknowns


Yet another area of uncertainty that might not be immediately obvious is the possibility of unknown unknowns — that is, all the things that might change with time. How do we know that our model — which relies heavily on figures like income and party affiliation — will still be able to draw conclusions about America 50 years from now? Mass migrations, political revolutions, and world wars are just a few of the things that could render all the conclusions we draw from the `trains` dataset moot. And, other than expanding our confidence intervals to the point of uselessness, there's no way to account for the unknown unknowns. 

In short, *while we can accept the model as representative of the United States at or around 2012 (the year in which Enos conducted his study), we cannot reasonably extrapolate that to the far future*.

It is always important to keep the problem of validity in the back of our minds as we investigate data sets and how the data within these sets are collected. Given the many factors — those we are aware of and those we are not aware of — that go into any kind of data collection, there is no way to guarantee 100 percent validity.


<!-- DK: I went fast above, but that is all the key material. Still need to add a Rubin Table example, highlighting that this is modeling for prediction. There is only one column for Y because it is impossible to change someone's age, whatever manipulations you make to party. -->


#### Testing is evil








## `att_end` as a function of `treatment`

Above, we created a predictive model: with someone's party affiliation, we can make a better guess as to what their age is. There was nothing causal about that model. Changing someone's party registration can not change their age. In this example, we build a causal model. What is the effect of exposing someone on a train platform to Spanish-speakers  on their attitudes toward immigration? 


### Wisdom

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.margin=TRUE, fig.cap="Wisdom"}
knitr::include_graphics("other/images/Wisdom.jpg")
```


### Justice

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.margin=TRUE, fig.cap="Justice"}
knitr::include_graphics("other/images/Justice.jpg")
```


### Courage

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.margin=TRUE, fig.cap="Courage"}
knitr::include_graphics("other/images/Courage.jpg")
```

```{r}
obj <- stan_glm(att_end ~ treatment - 1, data = trains, refresh = 0)

obj
```

Note that for both Democrats and Republicans, the prediction interval is significantly wider than the confidence interval. This discrepancy illustrates the *unmodeled variation* of the dataset: while the mean values, as indicated by the "fit" column, are still the best guess you can make for any given subject, we are less confident in the value range of that individual subject than we are of the value range of the mean. *The unmodeled variation widens the prediction intervals relative to the confidence intervals.*

Recall our discussion regarding the wider confidence intervals for Republican subjects than Democrat subjects. Although the Republican and Democrat average incomes had vastly different confidence intervals — the Republican confidence intervals were much wider — they have very similar prediction intervals. Although the *parameter uncertainty* of these two parameters were very different, the *unmodeled variation* for both parameters was roughly the same. Even though the data points were equally spread out for both Democrat and Republican income, were were able to more confidently pinpoint a true value for democrat income because we had more data to work with.

In many cases, the most important use of a model is for prediction. We use them to make predictions about data which we have not yet seen.



And we can reconstruct the table by filling in the unknowns with the predictions (note that these are unchanged) and their associated levels of uncertainty (which HAVE changed to accommodate for individual variation within the data):

```{r, echo = FALSE}

tibble(subject = c("7", "6,041", "67", "40,080", "758", "32", "8,809"),
       Control = c("8.45 (2.9-14.0)", "8.45 (2.9-14.0)", "8.45 (2.9-14.0)", "8.45 (2.9-14.0)", "5", "8.45 (2.9-14.0)", "13"),
       Treated = c("11", "10", "5", "11", "10 (4.4-15.6)", "13", "10 (4.4-15.6)")) %>% 
  
  gt() %>%
  cols_label(subject = md("**Subject**"),
                Control = md("**$$Y_c(u)$$**"),
                Treated = md("**$$Y_t(u)$$**")) %>%
  tab_style(cell_borders(sides = "right"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject))) %>%
  cols_align(align = "center", columns = TRUE) %>%
  tab_header(title = "Ending Attitudes on Immigration of 7 Random Respondents")
```





### Temperance

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.margin=TRUE, fig.cap="Temperance"}
knitr::include_graphics("other/images/Temperance.jpg")
```

There are various sources of uncertainties and problems that have addressed in previous chapters and again in this chapter. It's important that you always have these in the back of your mind when working with data:

1) *Validity*. At the surface level, parameter names might not invoke too much thought — but once you really sit down and think about the story the numbers are trying to tell, it's not always the case that the numbers deserve to tell that story. In our earlier discussion regarding `income` and `att_end`, the conclusions we draw from these data might be misleading just because the way they were collected or computed inevitably change these conclusions. Even when there's nothing WRONG with a setup, we need to keep in mind that the smallest differences 

2) When we dive deeper into the data, we run into the issue of *parameter uncertainty*, which is the uncertainty associated with our analysis of summary parameters, such as mean, median, and range. In our above analysis with the `trains` dataset, we account for parameter uncertainty using confidence intervals.

3) As great as confidence intervals are, they don't capture the uncertainty of using summary statistics to predict parameter values of random individuals. We are more sure, for example, about the range of possible incomes for the mean income of American democrats than we are about the range of possible incomes for a single American democrat, whose income could stray far from the mean democrat income. This *unmodeled variation*, or variation between data points that is not fully captured by bootstrapping, deserves much consideration when dealing with data.

4) *Unknown unknowns* are an especially unavoidable source of uncertainty. The world is changing, and people 50 years from now might act differently and have vastly different lifestyles and characteristics; in the case of the `trains` dataset, it wouldn't be unreasonable to expect completely different combinations of income and party affiliation. That would render our mean income, median ratio, and prediction intervals for both those measures useless.





The *fitted value* of att_end is 8.45 for the control group and 10 for the treated group. Because a higher att_end means more conservative towards stances on immigration, it seems that treated individuals had more conservative stances on this issue than the control group by the end of the study. 

### Model Structure

Our predictive model helped us make guesses as to what an individual's age is. However, that's just about all we can do with this relationship. Recall that the trains dataset was originally introduced in the context of the Rubin Causal Model back in Chapter \@ref(rubin-causal-model). That model cannot be applied to the relationship between party and income because these values were independently decided outside the experiment — although we were able to identify correlations between those two variables, the combinations of party and income were predetermined and not randomly assigned in a way that allows us to establish a causal relationship. If an individual suddenly decided to change party affiliations, we wouldn't suddenly expect his or her income to spike or plummet. 

In conclusion, while we can explore correlations or trends between party and income, we cannot label these correlations or trends as causal. However, `treatment` was a variable that was randomly assigned to subjects, and we have a variable that was measured after this random assignment, `att_end`. With this setup, we can calculate the Average Treatment Effect, or the average difference in `att_end` for treated subjects and control subjects. 

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

mean_ends <- trains %>% 
  group_by(treatment) %>% 
  summarize(mean_att_end = mean(att_end))

```

```{r}

ATE <- mean_ends$mean_att_end[2] - mean_ends$mean_att_end[1]

```

Now, let's make a Preceptor Table for this data:

```{r, echo = FALSE}

tibble(subject = c("1", "2", "...", "75", "...", "564", "565", "...", "10,627", "...", "N"),
       treatment = c("treated", "?", "...", "control", "...", "control", "?",  "...", "treated", "...", "?"),
       att_end = c("11", "?", "...", "5", "...", "13", "?",  "...", "11", "...", "?")) %>%
  gt() %>%
  cols_label(subject = md("**ID**"),
             att_end = md("**att_end**"),
             treatment = md("**treatment**")) %>%
  tab_style(cell_borders(sides = "right"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject))) %>%
  cols_align(align = "center", columns = TRUE) %>%
  tab_header("Preceptor Table of att_end ~ treatment") %>%
  fmt_markdown(columns = TRUE)

```

Preceptor Tables aim to capture all of the data such that if the question marks were filled out, one wouldn't need to construct a model. The rows in this Preceptor Table represent the N commuters on which our model is extrapolating, with N being the population of commuters using Boston public transportation. However, we're going to need a different kind of table if we want to display the causal effect of being treated -- more with this soon. 

Next, the second part of model structure, the formula. 

$$ y_i = b_1 x_t + b_2 x_c$$
Once again, we start here. We can make our parameters constants, $\hat{b_1}$ and $\hat{b_1}$, by assigning them to the estimates of the model. Plugging in these numbers outputs an estimated att_end for the observation, or our *fitted value*   $\hat{y_i}$. 

$$ \hat{y_i} = \hat{b_1} x_t + \hat{b_2} x_c  $$
$$ \hat{y_i} = 8.45x_t + 10x_c $$
When the individual is treated ($x_t$=1 and $x_c$=0), their fitted value is 8.45. When the individual is a control ($x_t$=0 and $x_c$=1), their fiited value is 42.6. 

Subtract the recorded att_end by fitted value for the epsilon value...
$$\epsilon_i = y_i - \hat{y_i}$$
...And you can now complete your equation.
$$ y_i = \hat{b_1}x_r + \hat{b_2} x_d + \epsilon_i $$
Note that the math for both the predictive model we worked on earlier and this model is *identical*. It is not the calculations for the residual, fitted value, or parameter estimates that differ between these two model types; rather, it is how one uses and interprets these numbers. While predictive models are simply used for predicting another variable's value (in the previous case, age), we can use these numbers to calculate the effect of one variable (treatment) on another (att_end) for each individual observation. 

Now, we'll create a Rubin Causal Model table of possible outcomes, as we did back in ch3. We'll do this using 7 random observations from the trains dataset. 

```{r}

#Adding question marks where necessary

trains_RCM <- trains %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = treatment, values_from = att_end) %>%
  slice(1:7) %>%
  mutate(subject = 1:7) %>%
  replace_na(list(Treated = "?", Control = "?")) %>% 
  select(subject, Control, Treated)

trains_RCM$subject <- c("7", "6,041", "67", "40,080", "758", "32", "8,809")

#Mathematical notation

trains_RCM %>%
  gt() %>%
  cols_label(subject = md("**Subject**"),
                Control = md("**$$Y_c(u)$$**"),
                Treated = md("**$$Y_t(u)$$**")) %>%
  tab_style(cell_borders(sides = "right"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject))) %>%
  cols_align(align = "center", columns = TRUE) %>%
  tab_header(title = "Ending Attitudes on Immigration of 7 Random Respondents")


```

Recall that the Rubin Causal Model centers on filling in the unknowns, which are indicated by the "?"s in the table. There's one way we could fill in the missing values — we could use our approximations we generated with our `lm()` model: that is, for each unknown Treated value, we use 10, and for each unknown Control value, we use 8.45. 

```{r, echo = FALSE}

tibble(subject = c("7", "6,041", "67", "40,080", "758", "32", "8,809"),
       Control = c("8.45", "8.45", "8.45", "8.45", "5", "8.45", "13"),
       Treated = c("11", "10", "5", "11", "10", "13", "10")) %>% 
  
  gt() %>%
  cols_label(subject = md("**Subject**"),
                Control = md("**$$Y_c(u)$$**"),
                Treated = md("**$$Y_t(u)$$**")) %>%
  tab_style(cell_borders(sides = "right"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject))) %>%
  cols_align(align = "center", columns = TRUE) %>%
  tab_header(title = "Ending Attitudes on Immigration of 7 Random Respondents")

```

```{r, include = FALSE}

library(tufte)

margin_note("The minimum att_end is 3 and maximum att_end is 15.")

```

This table looks a bit funky: take a look at subject 67. According to this model, subject 67's attitude under control would be HIGHER than his/her attitude under treatment, which corresponds to a negative treatment effect. This would mean that he/she would become more LIBERAL after undergoing treatment, which flies in the face of the ATE we calculated earlier. Another example of this can be seen with subject 32, whose predicted `att_end` under treatment is lower than his/her `att_end` under control (also signifying a shift towards liberal attitudes regarding immigration). 

Clearly, using the same control and treatment values to fill in the unknowns doesn't capture the entire picture as it does with a predictive model. While using `lm()` to fill in the `att_end` unknowns towards the center of the distribution, it makes less sense for values towards the outskirts of the dataset. So, how can we predict outcomes in a way that equally addresses data towards the center of the distribution, and data that isn't?

One such way is by attaching the ATE, which we previously calculated to be `r ATE`, in the appropriate direction to fill in the unknowns:

```{r, echo = FALSE}

#This is necessary so we can see the offset as caused by treatmentTreated, not treatmentControl.

trains$treatment <- fct_relevel(trains$treatment, "Control", "Treated")

lm(data = trains, att_end ~ treatment) %>% 
  tidy(conf.int = TRUE) %>%
  select(term, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)


tibble(subject = c("7", "6,041", "67", "40,080", "758", "32", "8,809"),
       Control = c("9.45", "8.45", "3.45", "9.45", "5", "11.45", "13"),
       Treated = c("11", "10", "5", "11", "6.55", "13", "14.55")) %>%
  gt() %>%
  cols_label(subject = md("**Subject**"),
                Control = md("**$$Y_c(u)$$**"),
                Treated = md("**$$Y_t(u)$$**")) %>%
  tab_style(cell_borders(sides = "right"),
            location = cells_body(columns = vars(subject))) %>%
  cols_align(align = "center", columns = TRUE) %>%
  tab_header(title = "Ending Attitudes on Immigration of 7 Random Respondents")

```

The usage of this table shows how a causal model is used differently than a predictive model. Unlike before, it wasn't enough to fill in our unknowns with the parameter estimates. This is because we aren't merely predicting their att_end, a variable that, unlike age, could be changed by exposure to a treatment variable. By using the ATE, we were able to make a more informed prediction on any individual's att_end had they been placed in the other group. 

### Parameter Uncertainty

Here, we see that the average treatment effect is `r ATE`; this is the average change in att_end caused by treatment (if this statistic looks unfamiliar, refer back to chapter 3 for a refresher on ATE). But how confident are we in this ATE? We can use `lm()` again to generate confidence intervals for our parameters and for this value:

```{r}
#This is necessary so we can see the offset as caused by treatmentTreated, not treatmentControl.

trains$treatment <-fct_relevel(trains$treatment, "Control", "Treated")

lm(data = trains, att_end ~ treatment - 1) %>% 
  tidy(conf.int = TRUE) %>%
  select(term, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)

summary(lm(data = trains, att_end ~ treatment - 1))

```

<!-- MB: Is this true  -->

Our measure of confidence for the ATE is known as the residual standard error, which in this case is 2.78. The residual standard error show our confidence in the average treatment effect of the `trains` dataset being representative of the true average treatment effect on Boston commuters.
