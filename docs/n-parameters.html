<p><em>This chapter is a draft.</em> Come back in a few weeks for a better version.</p>
<p>Having created models with one parameter in Chapter <a href="one-parameter.html#one-parameter">6</a>, two parameters in Chapter <a href="two-parameters.html#two-parameters">7</a> and three parameters in Chapter <a href="three-parameters.html#three-parameters">8</a>, you are now ready to make the jump to <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> parameters.</p>

<p>We will start off by using a subset of the <code>governors</code> data set from the <strong>PPBDS.data</strong> package. This data set looks at the lifespans of candidates for governor in the US. It comes from the paper “Longevity Returns to Political Office” by Barfort, Klemmensen and Larsen (2019), which concludes that winning a gubernatorial election increases a candidate’s lifespan.</p>

<p>There are 11 variables and 1092 observations. In this Chapter, we will only be looking at the variables <code>last_name</code>, <code>year</code>, <code>state</code>, <code>sex</code>, <code>alive_post</code>, and <code>alive_pre</code>.</p>

<p>There are a few things to note when looking at this data. First, the data set includes the variables <code>alive_pre</code> and <code>alive_post</code>, which tell us how many days a candidate lived before the election took place and how many days a candidate lived after the election, respectively. As a consequence, only politicians who are already deceased are included in this data set. This means that there are only a handful of observations from elections in the last 20 years. Most candidates from that time period are still alive and are, therefore, excluded.</p>
<!-- DK: Too much information? Not enough? -->
<p>Another caveat is that for a given election, only the top two candidates are included in the data. If a politician did not receive the highest or second-highest number of votes, they are excluded.</p>
<p>Finally, for some observations, only the birth or death year of a candidate could be determined and not the exact date. In those cases, the date was set as July 1st of that year.</p>

<p>This output groups the variables together by type (character, logical, numeric, etc.). We are given histograms of the numerical data. In looking at the histogram for <code>year</code>, we see that it is skewed right, with half of the observations from election years between 1945 and 1962. This makes sense logically, because we are only looking at deceased candidates, and candidates from more recent elections are more likely to still be alive.</p>
<p>In using this data set, our left-side variable will be <code>alive_post</code>. We are trying to understand/predict how many days a candidate will live after the election. Let’s look at some graphs and plots showing the relationships between <code>alive_post</code> and some of the other variables in our subset.</p>
<p><img src="book_temp_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-735-1.png" width="672"></p>
<p>Starting with the relationship between <code>alive_post</code> and <code>year</code>, we can see that the data is skewed right and that there is a rough line above which there are no observations. There are no data points in the top right portion of the graph because it is not possible to have run in 2011, lived 20,000 days after the election took place, and still have died before the data set was created. This line represents, approximately, the most a candidate could have possibly lived — and still have died — to be included the data set. The reason this line is slanted downward is because the maximum value for this scenario is greater in earlier years. That is, those candidates who ran for governor in earlier years could live a long time after the election and still have died prior to the data set creation, giving them higher <code>alive_post</code> values than those who ran for office in more recent years.</p>
<p>There are fewer observations in later years because fewer recent candidates have died.</p>

<p>This plot shows that men live much longer, on average, than women after the election. Does that make sense to you?</p>

<p>As frustrating as it might be, the relationship between the data you use and the question you wish to answer is never going to be as perfect as we hope. Let’s use our preceptor tables as an example. In an ideal world. our tables would have no question marks. Everything would be filled out, and calculating the numbers we are interested in would take minimal effort. However, the reality is that data is imperfect and messy. It is always necessary to ask the question, "Is the data we are using relevant to answer the question we ask?. Are the data sets we use too outdated to use in present day? Does the environment in which the population was sampled have factors that significantly influence one outcome to occur more often than the alternative? You can never ask too many questions.</p>
<p>However, questions should not be the only things on our mind. Ethics are equally important! Should we be making the model we seek to create? There are certain variables that we can encounter in data sets that are more dicey and controversial than others. Therefore, we must always be cautious and take a step back before we proceed.</p>
<!-- DK: Two paragraphs is plenty. Note this is a change. Topic is: If we want to predict how long someone will live, how relevant is this data set? (We are not interested in the question which the authors explore which is the causal effect of victory on lifespan.) We are making a predictive model, not a causal one. Can we use this model for any new person we meet? Only for people who are candidates? For people who are about as rich/successful/educated as the typical candidate? -->

</p>
<p>Because we will be going through a series of models in this chapter, it is useful to combine the virtues of Justice and Courage. To begin, let’s model candidate lifespan after the election as a function of candidate lifespan prior to the election. The data:</p>
<p><img src="book_temp_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-740-1.png" width="672"></p>
<p>The math is fairly simple:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ alive\_post_i =  \beta_0 + \beta_1 alive\_pre_i + \epsilon_i \]</span></p>
<p>with <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_i \sim N(0, \sigma^2)\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(alive\_post_i\)</span> is the number of days lived after the election for candidate <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(alive\_pre_i\)</span> is the number of days lived before the election for candidate <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_i\)</span> is the “error term,” the difference between the days-lived of candidate <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and the modeled days-lived of all candidates. <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_i\)</span> is normally distributed with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>. The key distinction is between:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Variables</em>, always subscripted with <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, whose values (potentially) vary across individuals.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Parameters</em>, never subscripted with <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, whose values are constant across individuals.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\beta_0\)</span> is the “intercept” of the regression, the average value for the population of <span class="math inline">\(alive\_post\)</span> for those for whom <span class="math inline">\(alive\_pre = 0\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span> is the “coefficient” of <span class="math inline">\(alive\_pre\)</span>. Each one day increase in <span class="math inline">\(alive\_pre\)</span> is associated with a <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span> change in <span class="math inline">\(alive\_post\)</span>. Again, this is the value for the population from which are data is drawn.</p>
<p>The concept of the “population” is subtle and important. <em>The population is not the set of candidates for which we have data.</em> That is the data set. The population is the larger — potentially much larger — set of individuals about whom we want to make inferences. <em>The parameters refer to the population, not to the data set.</em></p>
<p>Consider a simple example. Define <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> as the average number of days lived by candidates for governor after Election Day. Can we calculate <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> from our data? No! There are many candidates for governor who are still alive, who are not included in our data even though they are part of the “population” we want to study. <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> can not be <em>calculated.</em> It can only be <em>estimated.</em></p>
<p>Note, also, that there are many different populations, each with its own <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>, which we might be interested in.</p>
<!-- DK: Are these dates correct? -->
<ul>
<li><p>The population of all candidates for governor in the US from 1945 to 2012. This is the period covered in the paper.</p></li>
<li><p>The population of all candidates for governor in the US from 1900 to 2012. A priori, we would not expect a major difference between candidates who run in 1946 and those who run in 1942. How different could they be? It is therefore not unreasonable to extend the population of interest back in time, even if we have zero data for earlier periods.</p></li>
<li><p>The population of all candidates for governor in the US from 1945 to 2030. We are often interested in the future. We want to make predictions about what will happen to candidates, even to candidates who have not yet run for office.</p></li>
<li><p>The population of candidates for governor around the world. Other countries have governors also! We want to understand their longevity as well.</p></li>
<li><p>The population of candidates for all political offices in the US. We might expect candidates for Senator to have similar lifespans to candidates for Governor.</p></li>
<li><p>And so on. There are as many possible populations are there are questions we might ask.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>All of these populations are different, so each has a different <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>. Which <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> we are interested in depends on the problem we are trying to solve. It is a judgment call, a matter of Wisdom, as to whether or not that data we have is “close enough” to the population we are interested in to justify making a model.</p>
<p>Coming back to our model with <span class="math inline">\(alive\_pre\)</span>, there are three unknown parameters, similar to the situation we faced in Chapter <a href="three-parameters.html#three-parameters">8</a>.</p>
<p>You may recall from middle school algebra that the equation of a line is <span class="math inline">\(y = a + b x\)</span>. It is defined by two coefficients <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>. The intercept coefficient <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is the value of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> when <span class="math inline">\(x = 0\)</span>. The slope coefficient <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is the increase in <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> for every increase of one in <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. When defining a regression line, we use slightly different notation but the fundamental relationship is the same.</p>
<p>We can use <code>geom_smooth()</code> to create the fitted regression line:</p>
<p><img src="book_temp_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-741-1.png" width="672"></p>
<p>Consider someone who is about 5,000 says younger than the average candidate. We have a score or more data points for candidates around that age. Some of then only lived for about 5,000 days after the election. Others lived for more than 20,000 days. The world is filled with variation. But the fitted line tells us that, on average, we would expect a candidate that age to live for about 15,000 days after the election.</p>
<!-- DK: Add a red circle to the graphic to show how we figured that out? -->
<p>This model, with a continuous independent (or “predictor”) variable has an infinite number of fitted values, one for each possible value of <code>alive_pre</code>. This is very different from the models we saw in Chapter <a href="three-parameters.html#three-parameters">8</a>. Those models only had two possible fitted values because the predictor variable only took two possible values.</p>
<!-- DK: I am nervous that alive_pre, as used here, is a different variable that alive_pre when, later, we transform it.  -->
<p>We can implement this model with <code>stan_glm()</code>.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb936"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb936-1"><a href="n-parameters.html#cb936-1"></a>fit_gov_<span class="dv">1</span> &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">stan_glm</span>(<span class="dt">data =</span> ch9_gov,</span>

<p>As we discussed in Chapter <a href="three-parameters.html#three-parameters">8</a>, the most common term for a model like this is a “regression.” We have “regressed” <code>alive_post</code>, our dependent variable on <code>alive_pre</code>, our one independent variable.</p>
<p>The parameter values:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb937"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb937-1"><a href="n-parameters.html#cb937-1"></a><span class="kw">print</span>(fit_gov_<span class="dv">1</span>, <span class="dt">detail =</span> <span class="ot">FALSE</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>##             Median  MAD_SD 
## (Intercept) 26532.8   715.2
## alive_pre      -0.9     0.0
## 
## Auxiliary parameter(s):
##       Median MAD_SD
## sigma 4053.7   87.0</code></pre>
<p>As is almost always the case, <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> is a nuisance parameter, somethings whose value we are not interested in. This is why <code>stan_glm()</code> refers to it as an “Auxiliary” parameter.</p>
<p>The posterior distributions of <span class="math inline">\(\beta_0\)</span> (the intercept) and <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span> (the coefficient of <code>alive_pre</code>), on the other hand, are important. Before looking at the posteriors themselves, let’s examine the fitted values:</p>

<p><img src="book_temp_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-744-1.png" width="672"></p>
<p>This code is the same as the code we used above, except that we have replaced <code>geom_smooth()</code> with <code>geom_line()</code>. Calling <code>fitted()</code> on a model returns the set of fitted values, which we have plotted by hand.</p>
<p>We can create a formula for the fitted values by placing the median values of the parameters into the model:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ alive\_post_i =  26,524 - 0.9 alive\_pre_i + \epsilon_i\]</span></p>
<p>Consider the intercept. Since our independent variable is <code>alive_pre</code>, the intercept is the <code>alive_post</code> value when <code>alive_pre</code> is zero. Here, we would interpret this intercept as the average lifespan of a gubernatorial candidate after the election, if the candidate was alive for zero days prior to the election.</p>
<p>This is, of course, substantively nonsense. No one runs for office on the day they are born. In the next model, we will explore ways of making the intercept more interpretable. In the meantime, the math is the math.</p>
<p>Consider the coefficient for <code>alive_pre</code>, <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span>. The median of the posterior, -0.9, represents the slope of the model. For every unit increase in our independent variable, our dependent variable will change by this coefficient. Putting this slope definition in terms of our model, this means that for every additional day a candidate is alive before an election, their lifespan after the election will be 0.9 days lower, on average. If we are given the number of days a candidate lived before the election and want to estimate how long they will live for after, we will multiply the days they were alive prior by this beta of -0.9, then subtract that from the intercept.</p>
<p>This is a descriptive model, not a causal model. Remember our motto from Chapter <a href="rubin-causal-model.html#rubin-causal-model">3</a>: <em>No causation without manipulation.</em> There is no way, for person <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, to change the days that she has been alive on Election Day. On the day of this election, she is X days old. There is no way to change that. So, there are not two (or more) potential outcomes. Without more than one potential outcome, there can not be a causal effect.</p>
<p>Given that, it is important to monitor our language. We do not believe that that changes in <code>alive_pre</code> “cause” changes in <code>alive_post</code>. That is obvious. But there are some words and phrases — like “associated with” and “change by” — which are too close to causal. (And which we are guilty of using just a few paragraphs ago!) Be wary of their use. <em>Always think in terms of comparisons</em> when using a predictive model. We can’t change <code>alive_pre</code> from X to Y for an individual candidate. We can only compare two candidates (or two groups of candidates), one with <code>alive_pre</code> equal to X and the other with <code>alive_pre</code> equal to Y. If our model is correct, such candidates will, on average, differ in <code>alive_post</code> by <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span> times the difference between X and Y.</p>
<!-- DK: THis is a critical point. Maybe give a precise example? Go through the math slowly, like ModernDive does? Highlight this somehow? At the very least, we should emphasize the point for each model going forward. -->
<p>Let’s look at the posterior of <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span>, the coefficient of <code>alive_pre</code>:</p>
<!-- DK: We should standardize what these plots look like, both in this chapter and throughout the book. -->

<p>Centering is a tool that is used when the model’s intercept does not make substantive sense. To center a model, we pick a constant value, usually the mean of the independent variable, and subtract that constant from every value of the independent variable.</p>
<p>In this example, we want to center the value for <code>alive_pre</code>, the independent variable. First, we must pick the value that we will center by. Here, we will use the mean of <code>alive_pre</code>. Once we find this value, we will subtract it from every <code>alive_pre</code> value. We have, thereby, changed the meaning of <code>alive_pre</code>. It now means the number of days a candidate has been alive, as of Election Day, relative to the average days alive of all candidates on their respective election days.</p>

<p>In this model, we can see that the intercept has increased while the slope has stayed the same. When we interpret this model, we only have to change the definition of the intercept. Rather than the intercept representing the lifespan of a candidate who was alive for zero days before running for governor, it now represents the post-election lifespan of a gubernatorial candidate who was alive for the mean number of days before running. In this instance, our center value is approximately 18,892, so we will use this value in our interpretation. If a candidate was alive for 18,892 days before running for governor (the mean value in this data set), they are expected to live about 10,300 days after the election, on average.</p>
<!-- DK: Really need the ideal and actual Preceptor Table for this example. -->
<p>Always think in terms of unknown parameters. What do they mean? Which population do they represent? What ideal Preceptor Table would make their calculation easy? In this case, <span class="math inline">\(\beta_0\)</span> could be interpreted as the average number of days which gubernatorial candidates live after election day. If we had the ideal Preceptor Table, this would be trivial to calculate. Just take the average! No estimation required. But, our actual Preceptor Table has lots of missing values. In particular, many gubernatorial candidates have not . . . uh . . . died. (How inconsiderate!) So, we can’t know how many days they will live. All we can do is estimate a posterior probability distribution for <span class="math inline">\(\beta_0\)</span>.</p>
<p>Let’s now regress <code>sex</code> on <code>alive_post</code> to see how candidates’ post-election lifespans differ by sex.</p>

<p>In this regression, we use the -1 in the formula to make the output more straightforward, with no intercept to interpret. The math of this model is the same as those we saw in Chapter <a href="three-parameters.html#three-parameters">8</a>:</p>

<!-- DK: Provide more details on what each of the items in the formula means, even though this is a repeat of what we did in chapter 8. -->
<p>The meanings of <span class="math inline">\(y_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_i\)</span> are the same as in the first models. Indeed, they are the same throughout these exercises. <span class="math inline">\(x_{f,i}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x_{m,i}\)</span> are 0/1 variables, just like last chapter. They are <em>variables</em> whose value varies across individuals.</p>
<p>The important parameters are <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta_2\)</span>. They are the average days-lived post-election for, respectively, women and men. Again, this is not the “average” for the data we have. That is easy to calculate! No estimation required. <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta_2\)</span> are averages for the entire “population,” however we have chosen to define that term. Those averages can not be calculated directly. They can only be estimated, by creating a posterior probability distribution.</p>
<p>Looking back to the regression model we just created, we see that there is no intercept. Instead of having a <span class="math inline">\(b_0\)</span> value, we have <span class="math inline">\(b_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b_2\)</span> for female and male. This makes things easier to interpret. Without having to add or subtract anything from an intercept, this regression tells us that on average, women are expected to live about 6,000 days after running for governor, and men are expected to live 10,000 days.</p>
<p>This is a strange result. Why would men live twice as long as women after the election? One explanation for this might be that women don’t run for governor until later in life, and therefore are not expected to live as long.</p>
<!-- DK: Weird result, huh? Men live twice as long as women! Useful to discuss why that might be the case in more detail. -->
<p>Now that we have interpreted the model using a -1 in the formula to get both a <span class="math inline">\(b_1\)</span> value and a <span class="math inline">\(b_2\)</span> value, let’s take away the -1 and regress <code>alive_post</code> on and intercept and on <code>sex</code> to see how our equation changes.</p>

<p>From this result, we can see that we no longer have a value for female. However we do have an intercept. In this regression our mathematical regression formula is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ y_i = \beta_0  + \beta_1 x_{m,i} + \epsilon_i\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(b_0\)</span> is our intercept value which here would be around 5,850. You may notice that this is very similar to the female value from before. In this type of model, our intercept represents the characteristic of the variable that is left unrepresented in the model. Here our slope, or <span class="math inline">\(b_1\)</span> value, only shows up when the candidate is male. (If the candidate is female, then <span class="math inline">\(x_{m,i} = 0\)</span>. Therefore, the intercept value represents those who are not male: females.</p>
<p>When the candidate is a male, we add the coefficient for male to the intercept value, which gives us the average lifespan of a male gubernatorial candidate after an election. As we can see from adding <span class="math inline">\(b_0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b_1\)</span>, this value is the same as what we got for males in the previous model.</p>
<p>Be careful with notation! <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span> in the no-intercept model is different from <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span> in the model with an intercept! Notation varies. We must pay attention each time we make a model.</p>
<p>The posterior distribution for <span class="math inline">\(\beta_0 + \beta_1\)</span> can be constructed via simple addition.</p>

<p>The interpretation of this model is the same as we have seen before. There is a true average, across the entire population, of the number of days that male candidates live after the election. We can never know what that true average is. But, it seems highly likely that the true average is somewhere between 10,000 and 10,750 days.</p>
</div>
<div id="multiple-variable-regression" class="section level2">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">9.4</span> Multiple Variable Regression</h2>
<p>We are going to transition to working with a model that has more than one explanatory variable, x. Our outcome variable will be alive_post, but now we will have two different explanatory variables: alive_pre and sex. Note that sex is a continuous explanatory variable and alive_pre is numerical explanatory variable.</p>
<p>Here is the math we will be using:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ y_i =  \beta_0 + \beta_1 male_i + \beta_2 alive\_pre_i+ \epsilon_i \]</span>
Great! Now that we have our model, let’s break it down to explain what each part means.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>$ y_i$ is our outcome variable. In our case, the outcome variable is alive_post, the number of days a person is alive after the election. <span class="math inline">\(male_i\)</span> is one of our explanatory variables. If we are predicting the amount of days a male candidate lives after the election, this value will be 1. When we are making this prediction for female candidate, this value will be 0. <span class="math inline">\(alive_pre\)</span> is our other explanatory variable that represents the number of days a candidate has lived before the election.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\beta_0\)</span> is the avg. number of days lived after the election for women, who on the day of election, have been alive the avg. number of days of all candidates (i.e. both male and female). <span class="math inline">\(\beta_0\)</span> is also the intercept of the equation. In other words, <span class="math inline">\(\beta_0\)</span> is the expected value of $ y_i$ if <span class="math inline">\(male_i\)</span> = 0 and <span class="math inline">\(alive_pre\)</span> = 0. However, we can ignore that for our purpose because no one running for governor would have been alive 0 days before the election!</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span> is insignificant by itself. The only time it has meaning is when its value is connected to our intercept (i.e. <span class="math inline">\(\beta_0\)</span> + <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span>). When the two are added together, you get the avg. number of days lived after the election for men, who on the day of election, have been alive the avg. number of days of all candidates.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\beta_2\)</span> is, for the entire population, the avg. difference in <span class="math inline">\(y_i\)</span> between two individuals, one of whom has an alive_pre value of 1 greater than the other. Why is this important? Well, it just serves as a comparison for two otherwise identical people.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Now that we understand our model, let’s translate the following model into code.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb951"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb951-1"><a href="n-parameters.html#cb951-1"></a>fit_gov_<span class="dv">3</span> &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">stan_glm</span>(<span class="dt">data =</span> ch9_gov,</span>

<pre><code>##             Median MAD_SD
## (Intercept) 8103.0  896.4
## sexMale     2252.4  888.7
## alive_pre     -0.8    0.0
## 
## Auxiliary parameter(s):
##       Median MAD_SD
## sigma 4046.8   84.0</code></pre>
<p>Looking above at our results, you can see that our intercept value is 8069. What does this mean? Well, applying this to our discussion above, its significance would be that the average female candidate would be alive 8069 days lived after the election, who on the day of election, have been alive the avg. number of days of all candidates. Now take a look at the value 2281 next to sexMale. We need to connect this value to our intercept value to get something meaningful. Using our formula <span class="math inline">\(\beta_0\)</span> + <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span>, we find out how many days the average male candidate would be alive after the election, who on the day of election, have been alive the avg. number of days of all candidates. Our answer would be 10305.</p>
<p>Now take a look at the coefficient for alive_pre, <span class="math inline">\(\beta_2\)</span>. The median of the posterior, -0.8, represents the slope of the model. For every unit increase in our independent variable, our dependent variable will change by this coefficient. It makes sense that this value is negative. Think about it…the more days a candidate has has lived, the fewer days the candidate has left to live. So, for every extra day a candidate is alive before an election, their lifespan after the election will be 0.8 days lower, on average.</p>
<p>If we applied this knowledge to the model, we would get the following:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ y_i =  8052.5 + 2309male_i + -.8 alive\_pre_i+ \epsilon_i \]</span></p>
<p>Let’s look at some posteriors.</p>

<p>From this posterior, what can we interpret? Well, let’s take a look at both curves. You can clearly see that the distribution is spread out more than males. What does this mean?

<p>The coefficient for alive_pre is -.1. What does this mean? It is the slope for only females. So for every extra day a feamle candidate is alive before an election, their lifespan after the election will be 0.1 days lower, on average.
Now take a look below at the coefficient of sexMale:alive_pre, which is -.8. This is the value that must be added to the coefficient of alive_pre (recall <span class="math inline">\(\beta_2\)</span> + <span class="math inline">\(\beta_3\)</span>) in order to find the slope for males. When the two are added together, the value, or slope, is -.9. This means for every extra day a male candidate is alive before an election, their lifespan after the election will be 0.9 days lower, on average.</p>
<p>Now let’s take a look at some posterior graphics:</p>

<p>Talk about avg. differnece for women then men, slope for men is steeper etc.</p>
<p>For our last model, it will be very similar to the one we just created. However, we are now adding “state”, which will give us 55 different intercepts! Wow.</p>
<p>Here’s the math we will be using:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ y_i =  \beta_0 +  \beta_1 x_{AK,i} + \beta_1 x_{AR,i} + ... \beta_{49} x_{WY,i} + \beta_{50} male_i + \beta_{51} alive\_pre_i+ \beta_{52} male_i *  alive\_pre_i + \epsilon_i\]</span></p>
<!-- explain model -->
<p>This looks extremely overwhelming and terrifying. However, becomes quickly simplified once we understand what we are looking for.</p>

<p>Glance at the top of the list for states under the “A” section. Can you tell which state is missing? If you guessed Alabama, you are right! The (Intercept) refers to the avg. number of days lived after the election for women, who on the day of election, have been alive the avg. number of days of all female candidates in Alabama! That’s a mouthful. It really is not different than what we have been doing all along, however.</p>
<p>To find the avg. number of days lived after the election for women who on the day of election, have been alive the avg. number of days of all female candidates in a certain state, you just add the (Intercept) value, 4910.4 to whatever median value is next to that certain state.</p>
<p>However, we have only talked about women. What about for the men? Well, if you look at the bottom of the list, you will see the sexMale value 4410.1. When you wish to find alive_post for a specific state, you must add this value to the (Intercept), 4910.4, and then add the intercept of the desired state.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the posterior distribution for women in Washington and South Dakota.</p>

<p>Imagine you are running for Governor and want to do a better job of getting your voters to vote. You recently read about a large-scale experiment showing the effect of sending out a voting reminder that “shames” citizens who do not vote. You are considering sending out a “shaming” voting reminder yourself. What will happen if you do? Will more voters show up to the polls? Additionally, on the day of the election a female citizen is randomly selected. What is the probability she will vote?</p>
<p>Consider a new data set, <code>shaming</code>, corresponding to an experiment carried out by Gerber, Green, and Larimer (2008) titled “Social Pressure and Voter Turnout: Evidence from a Large-Scale Field Experiment”. This experiment used several hundred thousand registered voters and a series of mailings to determine the effect of social pressure on voter turnout.</p>
<p>Let’s now do another EDA, starting off by running <code>glimpse()</code>.</p>

<p>Here we see that <code>glimpse()</code> gives us a look at the raw data contained within the <code>shaming</code> data set. At the very top of the output, we can see the number of rows and columns, or observations and variables respectively. We see that there are 344,084 observations, with each row corresponding to a unique respondent. The “Columns: 10” tells us that there are 10 variables within this data set. Below this, we see a cutoff version of the entire data set that has the variables on the left as rows and the observations as a list separated by commas, as compared to the tibble output that presents with the variables as columns and the observations as rows running horizontally.</p>
<!-- It may be worth mentioning that general_04 is always "yes", unlike all the other voting history variables which have values of "yes" and "no". Why is that? I *think* that this is caused by their sampling plan. They found all the people who voted in the 2004 general election. Then, the authors found their history. As we would expect, those people had sometimes voted in the past and sometime not. Then, the authors sent the mailing. The key dependent variable, primary_06, is coding 0/1, since that makes doing the statistics easier. -->
<p>From this summary, we get an idea of some of the variables we will be working with. Variables of particular interest to us are <code>sex</code>, <code>hh_size</code>, and <code>primary_06</code>. The variable <code>hh_size</code> tells us the size of the respondent’s household, <code>sex</code> tells us the sex of the respondent, and <code>primary_06</code> tells us whether or not the respondent voted in the 2006 Primary election.</p>
<p>There are a few things to note while exploring this data set. You may – or may not – have noticed that the only response to the <code>general_04</code> variable is “Yes”. In their published article, the authors note that “Only registered voters who voted in November 2004 were selected for our sample” (Gerber, Green, Larimer, 2008). After this, the authors found their history then sent out the mailings.</p>
<p>It is also important to identify the dependent variable and its meaning. In this shaming experiment, the dependent variable is <code>primary_06</code>, which is a variable coded either 0 or 1 for whether or not the respondent voted in the 2006 primary election. This is the dependent variable because the authors are trying to measure the effect that the treatments have on the proportion of people who vote in the 2006 general election.</p>
<!-- HV: Should I include discussion of the left-hand variable (treatment?) here? Or wait until we move into the regressions? -->
<p>The voting results from other years, such as 2002 and 2004, are of less interest to us and can be removed from the abbreviated data set. In addition to removing <code>general_04</code>, <code>primary_02</code>, <code>general_02</code>, or <code>primary_04</code>, we also will not be taking particular interest in <code>birth_year</code>, or <code>no_of_names</code> within this chapter.
<!-- HV: should I explain why we are not using any of these variables? why they are not of great use to us? --></p>
<p>By narrowing down the set of variables we are looking at and investigating, we will find more meaningful relationships among them. However, we have not yet discussed the most important variable of them all: <code>treatment</code>. The <code>treatment</code> variable is a factor variable with 5 levels, including the control. Since we are curious as to how sending mailings affects voter turnout, the treatment variable will tell us about the impact each type of mailing can make. Let’s start off by taking a broad look at the different treatments.

<p>Four types of treatments were used in the experiment, with voters receiving one of the four types of mailing. All of the mailing treatments carried the message, “DO YOUR CIVIC DUTY - VOTE!”.</p>
<p>The first treatment, Civic Duty, also read, “Remember your rights and responsibilities as a citizen. Remember to vote.” This message acted as a baseline for the other treatments, since it carried a message very similar to the one displayed on all the mailings.</p>
<p>In the second treatment, Hawthorne, households received a mailing which told the voters that they were being studied and their voting behavior would be examined through public records. This adds a small amount of social pressure to the households receiving this mailing.</p>
<p>In the third treatment, Self, the mailing includes the recent voting record of each member of the household, placing the word “Voted” next to their name if they did in fact vote in the 2004 election or a blank space next to the name if they did not. In this mailing, the households were also told, “we intend to mail an updated chart” with the voting record of the household members after the 2006 primary. By emphasizing the public nature of voting records, this type of mailing exerts more social pressure on voting than the Hawthorne treatment.</p>
<p>The fourth treatment, Neighbors, provides the household members’ voting records, as well as the voting records of those who live nearby. This mailing also told recipients, “we intend to mail an updated chart” of who voted in the 2006 election to the entire neighborhood.</p>
<p>For now, let’s focus on a subset of the data.</p>

<p>Let’s focus on a few observations that may be relevant to our analysis. First, note that each treatment has approximately 38,000 respondents. The control group, denoted by Con, has approximately 190 thousand respondents. For the logical variable <code>solo</code>, we see that approximately 47 thousand of the total respondents live alone (TRUE), while approximately 296 thousand live in households greater than 1 (FALSE). It may also be important to note that the average age of the respondents is 49.8 years with a standard deviation of 14.4 years.</p>
<!-- DK: Add discussion of what you see here. No need to drop missing values since there aren't any. I think this next discussion can be dropped. -->
<p>To get a better sense of some respondents’ information, let’s use <code>sample_n()</code> to gather a random sample of <em>n</em> observations from the data set.</p>

<p>Now we have a table with 5 random observations and the respondents’ information in a regular table output. By taking a few random samples, we may start to see some patterns within the data. Do you notice anything in particular about the variable <code>treatment</code>?</p>
<p>One other helpful summarizing technique we can use is <code>skim()</code>. To make the information it contains simpler, we will only be looking at three variables: <code>primary_06</code>, <code>treatment</code>, and <code>sex</code>.</p>

<p>By running the <code>skim()</code> command, we get a summary of the data set as a whole, as well as the types of variables and individual variable summaries. At the top we see the number of columns and rows within the selected data set. Below this we are given a list with the different types of variables, or columns, and how often they appear within the data we are skimming. Following this, the variables are then separated by their column type, and we are given individual summaries based on the type.</p>
<!-- 2) `primary_06` as a function of `treatment` and `solo` and of their interaction. We will build up this model step-by-step, very similar to how we explored the effect of treatment in chapter 8.

Note that this situation is different from Chapter 8 in that fitted values and predicted values are not the same thing! The fitted value, for a combination of values for treatment and solo, is something 0.30, meaning that 30% of the people in this bucket votes. But the predicted value must be 0 or 1. Either you voted or you didn't. This example is clearly causal and so you need a Rubin Table with 4 potential outcome columns.

</p>
<p>Let’s consider one of the most important virtues of data science: wisdom. The map from our data to our question. Recall that our mission here is to increase our voter turnout while we are running for Governor.</p>
<p>To investigate this, we are given a dataset in which respondents were encouraged to vote under four treatments. This was accomplished by sending a letter to citizens that voted in the previous primary election with varying degrees of social pressure. The remainder of the respondents fall under a control group, which received no such mailings. The dataset offers a number of details about each respondent, including their age, sex, treatment type, and voting outcome.</p>
<p>What we truly want to know is <em>how to make citizens vote</em>. One immediate problem with our dataset is that, due to our study population, we are only studying people that voted in the previous primary election. In other words, if someone <em>did not</em> vote in the previous primary election, they were not included. This would be a large problem, since that means we can only figure out how to make citizens <em>that have already voted</em> vote. Though we can’t be sure, it is reasonable to assume that it is easier to encourage citizens to vote in the next primary election if they have a history of recently voting in primary elections.</p>
<p>Does this mean our data is unhelpful? Of course not! With four treatments (and therefore four different methods of encouraging voting), we can gain quite a bit of knowledge. Mostly, we will know the most effective way to incentivize people with a history of voting to vote again. We will also know if no method of persuasion (the control) is the best option. We will further be able to tell if certain methods of persuasion work better for certain groups of people, according to factors such as age, sex, or household size. This can help tremendously in our election.</p>
<p>That being said, the map from our question to our data is almost never perfect. In data science, we often have to look at our data, understand its limitations, and try our best to make inferences that help our cause.</p>

<span id="cb974-2"><a href="n-parameters.html#cb974-2"></a><span class="co">#                 formula = primary_06 ~ treatment - 1, </span></span>
<span id="cb974-3"><a href="n-parameters.html#cb974-3"></a><span class="co">#                 family = gaussian(), </span></span>
<span id="cb974-4"><a href="n-parameters.html#cb974-4"></a><span class="co">#                 refresh = 0)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This table shows us each of the five treatments and their beta coefficients, along with a 95% Confidence Interval for these coefficients. The Control provides us with a baseline.</p>
<!-- Talk about what these results mean.  Then, create the same model but with a different structure. -->
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb975"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb975-1"><a href="n-parameters.html#cb975-1"></a><span class="co"># obj.2 &lt;- stan_glm(data = shaming, </span></span>
<span id="cb975-2"><a href="n-parameters.html#cb975-2"></a><span class="co">#                 formula = primary_06 ~ treatment, </span></span>
<span id="cb975-3"><a href="n-parameters.html#cb975-3"></a><span class="co">#                 family = gaussian(), </span></span>
<span id="cb975-4"><a href="n-parameters.html#cb975-4"></a><span class="co">#                 refresh = 0)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<!-- Explain how these two models are the same, except in how they define the parameters. Show us the math like Gelman does. Write down the math. For simple. -->
<!-- Once we talk about these things --- and, again, this is exactly what we have talked about in chapter 8 --- we can do a bit more. Like discuss how we are using 99%, because there is nothing magical aboyt 95%, other than convention. I also think it would be fun to show a nice graphic of this, highlighting how the estimates for Civic and Hawthorne overlap.  -->
<div id="interactions" class="section level3">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">9.7.1</span> Interactions</h3>
<!-- This is new. With only two parameters, we can't really look at interaction effects. Need to discuss interaction effects in general. Also, note that heterogenous treatment effects are the same thing as interaction effects that involve a treatment effect as one of the variables.  -->
<!-- Feel free to build up this code, and other examples, more slowly than I am doing it here. -->
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb976"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb976-1"><a href="n-parameters.html#cb976-1"></a><span class="co"># obj.3 &lt;- stan_glm(data = shaming, </span></span>
<span id="cb976-2"><a href="n-parameters.html#cb976-2"></a><span class="co">#                 formula = primary_06 ~ sex + treatment + sex:treatment, </span></span>
<span id="cb976-3"><a href="n-parameters.html#cb976-3"></a><span class="co">#                 family = gaussian(), </span></span>
<span id="cb976-4"><a href="n-parameters.html#cb976-4"></a><span class="co">#                 refresh = 0)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<!-- Takes a while to explain what all this means. -->
<!-- Two key issues: 1) Interpreting lots of parameters in a model. interactions, heterogenous treatment effects. shaming using lm().  -->
<!-- Treatment effect is not the same thing as a coefficient. -->
<!-- 
intercept

Interactions --- use: income ~ party*something

heterogeneous treatment effects --- use:  att_start ~ treatment*something 
just a fancy way of saying interaction effects, but with a variable which us causal


What problems do we face? All the things that make modeling difficult. Why is this so hard? -->
<!-- Centering. -->
<!-- Might naively just take the value for each bucket. But that overfits! Need to put down some structure, like ordering. -->
<!-- income category, party id, pooling, age, -->
<!-- overfitting/underfitting bias/variance -->
<!-- We must have left bootstrapping behind by now. No more bootstraps, at least for the purpose of calculating uncertainty. (We will use it later for the purpose of out-of-sample testing and avoiding overfitting.) Key lesson is that overfitting is easy. You can't just estimate a value for each cell. You need to smooth and borrow strength. Of course, the only way to do that is with a Bayesian approach. Right? We don't want to get into hacked likelihood approaches. -->
<!-- cces looks perfect for this project. There are 400,000 rows, so it seems like you ought to have plenty of data for anything you want, but once you realize there are 51 states and 10 years, things get sparse fast. We only have 15 observations, for example, for Wyoming in 2007. Once you start subsetting by race and education, you have no choice but to start borrowing strength.  -->
<!-- So, just what will we use? rstanarm(). If so (and if we have not introduced it earlier), we can begin with seeing how it is similar to lm() and then expand. This means that, in one paramter chapter, we should be doing lm( ~ 1). In two parameter, lm( ~ treatment) --- if treatment is zero one --- or, perhaps better, lm( ~ -1 + treatment) if treatment is a factor/character with two levels. We might also have introduced  -->
<!-- MF: Is basic structure for this chapter meant to be [1] life span section, [2] shame section, and [3] interactions? -->

<!-- Add a couple more of the chapters? Or maybe put them in chapter 11? -->
<!-- Cut the recipe, bake, stuff? Not really needed for chapters 11 and 12. -->
<!-- Replace lm() with stan_glm()? -->
<!-- Get rid of multi-category example discussion? No! Hope to do pyTorch at some point. -->
<!-- 2) Each section ends with the code we have done. That seems redundant and confusing. -->
<!-- 3) Need to make the approach here mesh with the approaches used in chapter 11 and 12. What can we cut from here that is not used? How should we change later chapters to be consistent with this modern approach? -->
<!-- 4) I am concerned about the ames_snippets.R code used in the original but, maybe, not needed here. -->
<!-- 6) Many sections begun with a weird code chunk. These should be cleaned up and organized. -->
<!-- 7) Deal with the missing references. Need to add them to the bib. -->
<!-- 8) Maybe follow their example with r pkg(dplyr) instead of **dplyr**. -->
